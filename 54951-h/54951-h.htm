  <h3 id='MISSON' class='c007'>CAPTAIN MISSON.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Captain Misson was born in Provence, of
an ancient family. His father was master of a plentiful
fortune; but having a great number of children,
our rover had but little hopes of other fortune
than what he could carve out for himself with his
sword. His parents took care to give him an education
equal to his birth, and upon the completion
of it would have put him into the musketeers; but
as he was of a roving temper, and much affected
with the accounts he had read in books of travels,
he chose the sea as a life which abounds with more
variety, and would afford him an opportunity to
gratify his curiosity, by the change of countries.
Having made this choice, his father, with letters of
recommendation, and every thing fitting for him,
sent him to<a id='t5'></a> volunteer on board the Victoire, commanded
by Monsieur Fourbin, his relation. He was
received on board with all possible regard by the
Captain, whose ship was at<a id='t5a'></a> Marseilles, and was
ordered to cruise soon after Misson’s arrival. Nothing
could be more agreeable to the inclinations
of our volunteer than this cruise, which made him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>acquainted with the most noted ports in the Mediterranean,
and gave him a great insight into the
practical part of navigation. He grew fond of this
life, and was resolved to be a complete sailor, which
made him always one of the first on a yard arm,
either to hand or reef, and very inquisitive in the
different methods of working a ship: his discourse
was turned on no other subject, and he would often
get the boatswain and carpenter to teach him in
their cabins the constituent parts of a ship’s hull,
and how to rig her, which he generously paid them
for; and though he spent a great part of his time
with these two officers, yet he behaved himself with
such prudence that they never attempted any familiarity,
and always paid the respect due to his family.
The ship being at Naples, he obtained leave of his
captain to go to Rome, which he had a great desire
to visit. Hence we may date his misfortunes; for,
remarking the licentious lives of the clergy, (so different
from the regularity observed among the
French ecclesiastics,) the luxury of the Papal Court,
and that nothing but hulls of religion were to be
found in the metropolis of the christian church, he
began to figure to himself that all religion was no
more than a curb upon the minds of the weaker,
which the wiser sort yielded to, in appearance only.
These sentiments, so disadvantageous to religion
and himself, were strongly riveted by accidentally
becoming acquainted with a lewd priest, who was
at his arrival (by mere chance) his confessor, and
after that his procurer and companion, for he kept
him company to his death.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Misson at length became so much attached to
this man, that he advised him to go with him as volunteer,
and offered him money to clothe him: the
priest leaped at the proposal, and a letter coming to
Misson from his captain, that he was going to Leghorn,
and left it to him either to come to Naples, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>go by land; he chose the latter, and the Dominican,
whom he furnished with money, clothing himself
very cavalierly, threw off his habit, and preceded
him two days, staying at Pisa for Misson; from
whence they went together to Leghorn, where they
found the Victoire, and signior Caraccioli, recommended
by his friend, was received on board. Two
days after they weighed from hence, and after a
week’s cruise fell in with two Sallee-men, the one
of twenty, the other of twenty-four guns; the Victoire
had but thirty mounted, though she had ports
for forty. The engagement was long and bloody,
for the Sallee-men hoped to carry the Victoire; and,
on the contrary, Capt. Fourbin, so far from having
any thoughts of being taken, he was resolutely bent
to make prize of his enemies, or sink his ship. One
of the Sallee-men was commanded by a Spanish
renegade, (though he had only the title of a lieutenant)
for the captain was a young man who knew
little of marine affairs.</p>

<p class='c000'>This ship was called the Lion; and he attempted,
more than once, to board the Victoire; but by a
shot betwixt wind and water, he was obliged to
sheer off, and running his guns, &amp;c. on one side, to
bring her on the careen to stop his leak; this being
done with too much precipitation, she overset, and
every soul was lost. His comrade, seeing this disaster,
threw out all his small sails, endeavoured to
get off, but the Victoire wronged her, and obliged
her to renew the fight, which she did with great obstinacy,
and made Monsieur Fourbin despair of carrying
her if he did not board; he made preparations
accordingly. Signior Caraccioli and Misson were
the two first on board when the command was
given; but they and their followers were beat back
by the despair of the Sallee-men; the former received
a shot in his thigh, and was carried down
to the surgeon. The Victoire laid her on board the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>second time, and the Sallee-men defended their
decks with such resolution, that they were covered
with their own, and the dead bodies of their enemies.
Misson seeing one of them jump down the
main hatch with a lighted match, suspecting his
design, resolutely leaped after him, and reaching
him with his sabre, laid him dead the moment he
was going to set fire to the powder. The Victoire
pouring in more men, the Mahometans quitted the
decks, finding resistance vain, and fled for shelter
to the cook-room, steerage, and cabins, and some
ran between decks. The French gave them quarters,
and put the prisoners on board the Victoire,
the prize yielding nothing worth mention, except
liberty to about fifteen Christian slaves; she was
carried into and sold with the prisoners at Leghorn.
The Turks lost a great many men; the French not
less than 35 in boarding, for they lost very few by
the great shot, the Sallee-men firing mostly at the
masts and rigging, hoping by disabling to carry
her. The limited time of their cruise being out, the
Victoire returned to Marseilles, from whence Misson
taking his companion, went to visit his parents, to
whom the captain sent a very advantageous character,
both of his courage and conduct. He was
about a month at home when his captain wrote to
him, that his ship was ordered to Rochelle, from
whence he was to sail for the West-Indies with some
merchantmen. This was very agreeable to Misson
and signior Caraccioli, who immediately set out for
Marseilles. This town is well fortified, has four
parish churches, and the number of inhabitants is
computed to be about 120,000; the harbour is esteemed
the safest in the Mediterranean, and is the
common station for the French gallies.</p>

<p class='c000'>Leaving this place, they steered for Rochelle,
where the Victoire was docked, the merchant ships
not being near ready. Misson, who did not care to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>pass so long a time in idleness, proposed to his
comrade the taking a cruise on board the Triumph,
which was going into the English channel; and the
Italian readily consented to it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Between the Isle of Guernsey and the Start
Point, they met with the Mayflower, Capt. Balladine,
commander, a merchant ship of 18 guns, richly
laden, and coming from Jamaica. The captain of
the English made a gallant resistance, and fought
his ship so long, that the French could not carry
her into harbour, wherefore they took the money,
and what was most valuable, out of her; and finding
she made more water than the pumps could free,
quitted, and saw her go down in less than four hours
after. Monsieur Le Blanc, the French captain, received
Capt. Balladine very civilly, and would not
suffer either him or his men to be stripped, saying,
<em>None but cowards ought to be treated after that
manner; that brave men ought to treat such, though
their enemies, as brothers; and that to use a gallant
man (who does his duty) ill, speaks a revenge
which cannot proceed but from a coward soul</em>. He ordered
that the prisoners should have their chests;
and when some of his men seemed to mutter, he
bade them remember the grandeur of the monarch
they served; that they were neither pirates nor
privateers; and as brave men, they ought to show
their enemies an example they would willingly
have followed, and use their prisoners as they
wished to be used.</p>

<p class='c000'>They then run up the English channel as high as
Beachy Head, and, in returning, fell in with three
fifty gun ships; which gave chase to the Triumph;
but as she was an excellent sailor, she run them
out of sight in seven glasses, and made the best of
her way for the Land’s-End. They here cruised
eight days, then doubling Cape Cornwall, ran up
the Bristol channel, near as far as Nash Point, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>intercepted a small ship from Barbadoes, and
stretching away to the northward, gave chase to a
ship they saw in the evening, but lost her in the
night. The Triumph then stood towards Milford,
and spying a sail, endeavoured to cut her off the
land, but found it impossible; for she got into the
haven, though they came up with her very fast,
and she had surely been taken had the chase been
any thing longer.</p>

<p class='c000'>Capt. Balladine, who took the glass, said it was
the Port Royal, a Bristol ship, which left Jamaica
in company with him and the Charles. They now
returned to their own coast, and sold their prize
at Brest, where, at his desire, they left Capt. Balladine,
and Monsieur Le Blanc made him a present
of a purse with 40 <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">louis</span></i> for his support. His crew
were also left here.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the entrance into this harbour the Triumph
struck upon a rock, but received no damage. This
entrance, called Gonlet, is very dangerous on account
of the number of rocks which lie on each side
under water, though the harbour is certainly the best
in France. The mouth of the harbour is defended by
a strong castle; the town is well fortified, and has a
citadel for its farther defence, which is of considerable
strength. In 1694 the English attempted a descent,
but did not find their market, for they were
beat off with the loss of their general, and a great many
men. From hence the Triumph returned to Rochelle,
and in a month after, our volunteers, who
went on board the Victoire, took their departure for
Martinico and Guadaloupe. They met with nothing
in their voyage thither worth noting. I shall only
observe, that signior Caraccioli, who was as ambitious
as he was irreligious, had, by this time, made a
perfect deist of Misson, and thereby convinced him,
that all religion was no other than human policy.
But his arguments on this head are too long, and too
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>dangerous to translate; and as they are worked
up with great subtlety, they may be pernicious to
weak men, who cannot discover their fallacy, or
who, finding them agreeable to their inclinations,
would be glad to shake off the yoke of the christian
religion, which galls and curbs their passions, and
would not give themselves the trouble to examine
them to the bottom, but give it to what pleases,
glad of finding some excuse to their consciences.</p>

<p class='c000'>As he had privately held these discourses among
the crew, he had gained a number of proselytes,
who looked upon him as a new prophet risen up to
reform the abuses in religion; and a great number
being Rochellers, and, as yet, tainted with Calvanism,
his doctrine was the more readily embraced.
When he had experienced the affects of his religious
arguments, he fell upon government, and showed,
that every man was born free, and had as much right
to what would support him, as to the air he respired.
A contrary way of arguing would be accusing the
deity with cruelty and injustice, for he brought into
the world no man to pass a life of penury, and to
miserably want a necessary support; that the vast
difference between man and man, one wallowing in
luxury, and the other in the most pinching necessity,
was owing only to avarice and ambition on the
one hand, and a pusillanimous subjection on the
other; that at first no other than a natural was known
a paternal government, every father was the head,
the prince and monarch of his family, and obedience
to such was both just and easy, for a father had compassionate
tenderness for his children; but ambition
creeping in by degrees, the stronger family set upon
and enslaved the weaker; and this additional
strength over-run a third, by every conquest gathering
force to make others, and this was the first
foundation of monarchy. Pride increasing with
power, man usurped the prerogative of God, over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>his creatures, that of depriving them of life, which
was a privilege no one had over his own; for as he
did not come into the world by his own election, he
ought to stay the determined time of his creator;
that indeed, death given in war, was by the law of
nature allowable, because it is for the preservation
of our own lives; but no crime ought to be thus
punished, nor indeed any war undertaken, but in
defence of our natural right, which is such a share
of earth as is necessary for our support.</p>

<p>Engagement between the Victoire and Winchelsea.—The Winchelsea blew up. &#8196; &#8196; &#8196; Page <a href='#Page_12'>12</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>These topics he often declaimed on, and very often
advised with Misson about the setting up for themselves;
he was as ambitious as the other, and as
resolute. Caraccioli and Misson were by this, expert
mariners, and very capable of managing a ship;
Caraccioli had sounded a great many of the men on
this subject, and found them very inclinable to listen
to him. An accident happened which gave Caraccioli
a fair opportunity to put his designs in execution,
and he laid hold of it. They went off Martinico
on a cruise, and met with the Winchelsea, an
English man of war of 40 guns, commanded by Capt.
Jones; they made for each other, and a very smart
engagement followed; the first broadside killed the
captain, second captain, and the three lieutenants,
on board the Victoire, and left only the master, who
would have struck, but Misson took up the sword,
ordered Caraccioli to act as lieutenant, and encouraging
the men fought the ship six glasses, when by
some accident the Winchelsea blew up, and not a
man was saved but Lieut. Franklin, whom the French
boats took up, and he died in two days. None ever
knew before this manuscript fell into my hands, how
the Winchelsea was lost; for her head being driven
ashore at Antigua, and a great storm having happened
a few days before it was found, it was concluded,
that she foundered in that storm. After this
engagement, Caraccioli came to Misson and saluted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>him captain, and desired to know if he would choose
a momentary or a lasting command, that he must
now determine, for at his return to Martinico it would
be too late; and he might depend upon the ship he
fought and saved being given to another, and they
would think him well rewarded if made a lieutenant
which piece of justice he doubted; that he had his
fortune in his hands, which he might either keep
or let go; if he made choice of the latter, he must
never again expect she would court him to accept
her favours; that he ought to set before his eyes his
circumstances, as a younger brother of a good family,
but nothing to support his character; and the
many years he must serve at the expense of his
blood before he could make any figure in the world,
and consider the wide difference between the commanding
and being commanded; that he might with
the ship he had under foot, and the brave fellows
under command, bid defiance to the power of Europe,
enjoy every thing he wished, reign sovereign
of the Southern Seas, and lawfully make war on all
the world, since it would deprive him of that liberty
to which he had a right by the laws of nature, that
he might in time, become as great as Alexander was
to the Persians: and by increasing his forces by captures,
he would every day strengthen the justice of
his cause, for who has power is always in the right.
That Harry the fourth and Harry the seventh, attempted
and succeeded in their enterprises on the
crown of England, yet their forces did not equal his.
Mahomet with a few camel drivers, founded the Ottoman
empire; and Darius, with no more than six or
seven companions, got possession of that of Persia.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a word, he said so much that Misson resolved
to follow his advice, and calling up all hands, he
told them, “That a great number of them had resolved
with him upon a life of liberty, and had done
him the honor to create him chief; that he designed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>to force no man, and be guilty of that injustice he
blamed in others; therefore, if any were averse to
the following his fortune, which he promised should
be the same to all, he desired they would declare
themselves, and he would set them ashore, whence
they might return with conveniency.” Having made
an end, they one and all cried, “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive le Captain Misson
et son Lieutenant le savant Caraccioli</span></i>“—<em>God bless
Captain Misson and his learned Lieutenant Caraccioli</em>.
Misson thanked them for the honor they conferred
upon him, and promised he would use the power
they gave for the public good only, and hoped as
they had the bravery to assert their liberty, they
would be as unanimous in the preservation of it,
and stand by him in what should be found expedient
for the good of all; that he was their friend and
companion, and should never exert his power, or
think himself other than their comrade, but when
the necessity of affairs should oblige him.</p>

<p class='c000'>They shouted a second time, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive le Capitain</span></i>: he,
after this, desired they would choose their subaltern
officers, and give them power to consult and
conclude upon what might be for the common interest,
and bind themselves down by an oath to
agree to what such officers and he should determine;
this they readily gave in to. The schoolmaster
they chose for second lieutenant, Jean Besace
they nominated for third, and the boatswain,
and a quarter master, named Mathieu le Tondu,
with the gunner they desired might be their representatives
in council. The choice was approved,
and that every thing might pass methodically, and
with general approbation, they were called into the
great cabin, and the question put, <em>What course they
should steer?</em> The captain proposed the Spanish
coast as the most probable to afford them rich prizes.
This was agreed upon by all. The boatswain then
asked what colours they should fight under, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>advised black as the most terrifying, but Caraccioli
objected, “that they were no pirates, but men who
were resolved to assert that liberty which God and
nature gave them, and own no subjection to any,
farther than was for the common good of all: that
indeed obedience to governors was necessary, when
they knew and acted up to the duty of their function;
were vigilant guardians of the people’s rights
and liberties; saw that justice was equally distributed;
were barriers against the rich and powerful,
when they attempted to oppress the weaker; when
they suffered none on the one hand to grow immensely
rich, either by his own or his ancestor’s
encroachments: nor on the other, to be wretchedly
miserable, either by falling, into the hands of
villains, unmerciful creditors, or other misfortunes;
while he had eyes impartial, and allowed nothing
but merit to distinguish between man and man;
and instead of being a burthen to the people by his
luxurious life, he was by his care for, and protection
of them, a real father, and in everything acted with
the equal and impartial justice of a parent: but
when a governor, who is the minister of the people,
thinks himself raised to this dignity, that he may
spend his days in pomp and luxury, looking upon
his subjects as so many slaves, created for his use
and pleasure, and therefore leaves them and their
affairs to the immeasurable avarice and tyranny of
some one whom he has chosen for his favourite;
when nothing but oppression, poverty and all the
miseries of life flow from such an administration;
that he lavishes away the lives and fortunes of the
people, either to gratify his ambition, or to support
the cause of some neighbouring prince, that he may
in return, strengthen his hands should his people
exert themselves in defence of their native rights;
or should he run into unnecessary wars, by the rash
and thoughtless councils of his favourite, and not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>able to make head against the enemy he has rashly
or wantonly brought upon his hands, and buy a
peace (which is the present case of France, as every
one knows, by supporting King James, and afterwards
proclaiming his son) and drain the subject;
should the people’s trade be wilfully neglected, for
private interests, and while their ships of war lie
idle in their harbours, suffer their vessels to be
taken; and the enemy not only intercepts all commerce,
but insults their coasts: it speaks a generous
and great soul to shake off the yoke; and if we cannot
redress our wrongs, withdraw from sharing the
miseries which meaner spirits submit to, and scorn
to yield to the tyranny. Such men as we, and, if the
world, as experience may convince us it will, makes
war upon us, the law of nature empowers us not
only to be on the defensive, but also on the offensive
part. As we then do not proceed upon the same
ground with pirates, who are men of dissolute lives
and no principles, let us scorn to take their colours;
ours is a brave, a just, an innocent, and a
noble cause; the cause of liberty. I therefore advise
a white ensign, with liberty painted in the fly,
and if you like the motto, “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">a Deo a libertate</span></i>,” for
God and liberty, as an emblem of our uprightness
and resolution.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The cabin door was left open, and the bulk-head,
which was of canvass, rolled up: the steerage being
full of men, who lent an attentive ear, they cried,
“<em>Liberty, Liberty; we are free men: Vive the brave
Capt. Misson and the noble Lieut. Caraccioli!</em>” This
short council breaking up, every thing belonging
to the deceased captain, and the other officers, and
men lost in the engagement, was brought upon
deck and overhauled; the money ordered to be put
into a chest, and the carpenter to clap on a padlock,
and give a key to every one of the council; Misson
telling them, all should be in common, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>particular avarice of no one should defraud the
public.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the plate Monsieur Fourbin had, was going
to the chest, the men unanimously cried out “avast!
keep that out for the captain’s use, as a present
from his officers and foremast men.” Misson thanked
them, the plate was returned to the great cabin,
and the chest secured according to orders: Misson
then ordered his lieutenants and other officers to
examine who among the men, were in most want of
clothes, and to distribute those of the dead men impartially,
which was done with the general consent
and applause of the whole crew. All but the wounded
being upon deck, Misson from the barricade,
spoke to the following purpose, “That since they
had unanimously resolved to seize upon and defend
their liberty, which ambitious men had usurped,
and that this could not be esteemed by impartial
judges other than a just and brave resolution, he
was under an obligation to recommend to them a
brotherly love to each other; the banishment of all
private piques and grudges, and a strict agreement
and harmony among themselves; that in throwing
off the yoke of tyranny, of which the action spoke
an abhorrence, he hoped none would follow the example
of tyrants, and turn his back upon justice;
for when equity was trodden under foot, misery,
confusion, and mutual distrust naturally followed.”
He also advised them to remember there was a Supreme,
the adoration of whom, reason and gratitude
prompted us to, and our own interest would
engage us (as it is best to be of the sure side, and
after-life was allowed possible) to conciliate: that
he was satisfied men who were born and bred in
slavery, by which their spirits were broke, and were
incapable of so generous a way of thinking, who,
ignorant of their birth-right, and the sweets of liberty
dance to the music of their chains, which was,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>indeed the greater part of the inhabitants of the
globe, would brand this generous crew with the invidious
name of pirates, and think it meritorious to
be instrumental in their destruction. Self-preservation,
therefore, and not a cruel disposition, obliged
him to declare war against all such as should
refuse him the entry of their ports, and against all,
who should not immediately surrender and give
up what their necessities required; but in a more
particular manner against all European ships and
vessels, as concluded implacable enemies. <em>And I
do now</em>, said he, <em>declare such war, and, at the same
time, recommend to you, my comrades, a humane and
generous behaviour, towards your prisoners; which
will appear by so much more the effects of a noble
soul, as we are satisfied we should not meet the same
treatment should our ill fortune, or more properly
our disunion, or want of courage, give us up to their
mercy</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>After this, he required a muster should be made,
and there were able hands two hundred, and thirty-five
sick and wounded. As they were mustered,
they were sworn. After affairs were thus settled,
they shaped their course for the Spanish West-Indies,
but resolved in the way, to take a week or
ten days’ cruise in the windward passage from Jamaica,
because most merchantmen, which were
good sailers, and did not stay for convoy, took this
as the shorter cut for England.</p>

<p class='c000'>Off St. Christopher’s they took an English sloop
becalmed, with their boats. They took out of her
a couple of puncheons of rum, and half a dozen
hogsheads of sugar. She was a New-England
sloop, bound for Boston, and without offering the
least violence to the men, or stripping them, they
let her go. The master of the sloop was Thomas
Butler, who owned he never met with so candid an
enemy as the French man of war, which took him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>the day he left St. Christophers. They met with no
other booty in their way, till they came upon their
station, when after three days, they saw a sloop
which had the impudence to give them chase.
Capt. Misson asked what could be the meaning of
the sloop standing for them? One of the men who
was acquainted with the West-Indies, told him, it
was a Jamaica privateer, and he should not wonder,
if he clapped him aboard. “I am,” said he, “no
stranger to their way of working, and this despicable
fellow, as those who don’t know a Jamaica privateer
may think him, it is ten to one will give you
some trouble. It now grows towards evening, and
you’ll find as soon as he has discovered your force,
he’ll keep out of the reach of your guns till the 12
o’clock watch is changed at night, and he’ll then attempt
to clap you aboard, with hopes to carry you
in the hurry: wherefore, captain, if you will give me
leave to advise you, let every man have his small
arms; and at 12, let the bell ring as usual, and rather
more noise than ordinary be made, as if the one
watch was turning in, and the other out, in a confusion
and hurry, and I’ll engage he will venture to
enter his men.” The fellow’s advice was approved
and resolved upon, and the sloop worked as he said
she would; for upon coming near enough to make
out distinctly the force of the Victoire, on her throwing
out French colours, she, the sloop, clapped upon
a wind, and the Victoire gave chase, but without
hopes of gaining upon her; she went so well to windward,
that she could spare the ship some points in
her sheet, and yet wrong her: at dusk of the evening,
the French had lost sight of her, but about 11 at
night, they saw her hankering up on their weather
bow, which confirmed the sailor’s opinion, that she
would attempt to board them, as she did at the
pretended change of the watch; there being little or
no wind, she lashed to the bowsprit of the Victoire,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>and entered her men, who were very quietly taken,
as they entered, and tumbled down the fore-hatch
where they were received by others, and bound
without noise. Not one of the privateersmen was
killed, few hurt, and only one Frenchman wounded.
The Victoire, seeing the better part of the sloop’s
men secured, they boarded in their turn, when the
privateersmen, suspecting some stratagem, were
endeavouring to cut their lashing and get off. Thus
the Englishmen caught a Tartar. The prisoners
being all secured, the captain charged his men not
to discover, through a desire of augmenting their
number, the account they were upon.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next morning Monsieur Misson called for the
captain of the privateer, and told him, he could not
but allow him a brave fellow, to venture upon a ship
of his countenance, and for that reason he should
meet treatment which men of his profession seldom
afforded the prisoners they made. He asked him
how long he had been out, what was his name, and
what he had on board? He answered he was but
just come out, that he was the first sail he had met
with, and should have thought himself altogether
as lucky not to have spoke with him; that his name
was Harry Ramsey, and what he had on board were
rags, powder, ball, and some few half ankers of
rum. Ramsey was ordered into the gun-room, and
a council was held in the public manner aforesaid,
the bulk-head of the great cabin being rolled up.
On their conclusion, the captain of the privateer
was called in again, when Capt. Misson told him,
he would return him his sloop, and restore him and
his men to their liberty, without stripping or plundering
them of any thing, but what prudence obliged
him to, their ammunition and small arms, if he
would give him his word and honour, and his men
take an oath, not to go out on the privateer account
in six months after they left him: that he did not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>design to continue on that station above a week
longer, at the expiration of which time, he would
let them go.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ramsay, who had a new sloop, did not expect
this favour which he thanked him for, and promised
punctually to comply with the injunction, which
his men as readily swore to, though they had no
design to keep the oath. The time being expired,
he and his men were put on board their own sloop.
At going over the ship’s side, Ramsay begged Monsieur
Misson would allow him powder for a salute,
by way of thanks; but he answered him, the ceremony
was needless, and he expected no other
return than that of keeping his word, which indeed
Ramsay did. Some of his men had found it more
to their advantage to have been as religious.</p>

<p class='c000'>At parting Ramsey gave the ship three cheers,
and Misson had the complaisance to return one,
which Ramsay answering with three more, made
the best of his way for Jamaica, and at the east end
of the island met with the Diana, who, upon advice,
turned back.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Victoire steered for Carthagena, off which
port they cruised some days, but meeting with nothing
in those seas, they made for Porto Bello; in
their way they met with two Dutch traders, who
had letters-of-marque, and were just come upon
the coast, the one had 20, the other 24 guns; Misson
engaged them, and they defended themselves
with a great deal of resolution and gallantry; and
as they were manned apeak, he durst not venture
to board either of them, for fear of being at the
same time boarded by the other. His weight of
metal gave him a great advantage over the Dutch,
though they were two to one; besides, their business,
as they had cargoes, was to get off, if possible,
wherefore they made a running fight, though they
took care to stick close to one another.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>They maintained the fight for above six hours,
when Misson, enraged at this obstinacy, and fearing,
if by accident they should bring a mast, or top-mast
by the board, they would get from him, he
was resolved to sink the larger ship of the two, and
accordingly ordered his men to bring all their guns
to bear a midship, then running close along side of
him, to raise their metal, his orders being punctually
obeyed, he poured in a broadside, which opened
such a gap in the Dutch ship that she went directly
to the bottom, and every man perished.</p>

<p class='c000'>He then manned his bowsprit, brought his sprit
sail yard fore and aft, and resolved to board the
other, which the Dutch perceiving, and terrified
with the unhappy fate of their comrade, thought
a farther resistance vain, and immediately struck.
Misson gave them good quarters, though he was
enraged at the loss of thirteen men killed outright,
beside nine wounded, of which six died. They
found on board a great quantity of gold and silver
lace, brocade silks, silk stockings, bales of broadcloth,
baizes of all colours, and osnaburgs.</p>

<p class='c000'>A consultation being held, it was resolved Capt.
Misson should take the name of Fourbin, and returning
to Carthagena, dispose of his prize, and set
his prisoners ashore. Accordingly they plied to the
eastward, and came to an anchor between Boca
Chicca fort, and the town, for they did not think it
expedient to enter the harbour. The barge was
manned, and Caraccioli, with the name of D’Aubigny,
the first lieutenant, who was killed in the engagement
with the Winchelsea, and his commission
in his pocket, went ashore with a letter to the governor,
signed Fourbin, whose character, for fear of the
worst was exactly counterfeited. The purport of
his letter was, that having discretionary orders to
cruise for three months, and hearing the English
infested his coast he was come in search of them,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>and had met two Dutchmen, one of which he had
sunk, the other he made prize of. That his limited
time being near expired, he should be obliged to his
excellency, if he would send on board him such
merchants as were willing to take the ship and cargo
off his hands, of which he had sent the Dutch invoice.
Don Joseph de la Zerda, the then governor,
received the lieutenant (who sent back the barge
at landing) very civilly, and agreed to take the prisoners
ashore, and do every thing that was required
of him; and ordering fresh provisions and vegetables
to be got ready as a present for the captain, he
sent for some merchants, who were very ready to
go on board, and agree for the ship and goods; which
they did, for fifty-two thousand pieces of eight.
The next day the prisoners were set ashore; a rich
piece of brocade which was reserved, sent to the
governor for a present, a quantity of fresh provision
bought and brought on board, the money paid
by the merchants, the ship and goods delivered, and
the Victoire, at the dawn of the following day, got
under sail. It may be wondered how such despatch
could be made, but the reader must take notice,
these goods were sold by the Dutch invoice, which
the merchant of the prize affirmed was genuine.
I shall observe, by the by, that the Victoire was the
French man of war which Admiral Wager sent the
Kingston in search of, and being afterwards falsely
informed, that she was joined by another of 70 guns,
and that they cruised together between the Capes,
ordered the Severn up to windward, to assist the
Kingston, which had like to have proved very fatal;
for these two English men of war, commanded by
Capt. Trevor and Capt. Pudnor, meeting in the
night, had prepared to engage, each taking the
other for the enemy. The Kingston’s men not having
a good look-out which must be attributed to
the negligence of the officer of the watch, did not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>see the Severn till she was just upon them; but by
good luck, to leeward, and plying up, with all the
sail she could crowd, and a clear ship. This put
the Kingston in such confusion, that when the Severn
hailed, no answer was returned for none heard
her. She was got under the Kingston’s stern, and
Capt. Pudnor ordered to hail for the third and last
time, and if no answer was returned, to give her
a broadside. The noise on board the Kingston was
now a little ceased, and Capt. Trevor, who was on
the poop with a speaking trumpet, to hail the Severn,
by good luck heard her hail him, and answering
the Kingston, and asking the name of the other
ship, prevented the damage.</p>

<p class='c000'>They cruised together some time, and meeting
nothing which answered their information, returned
to Jamaica, as I shall to my subject, begging pardon
for this, as I thought, necessary digression.</p>

<p class='c000'>Don Juan de la Zerda told the captain in a letter,
that the St. Joseph, a galleon of 70 guns, was then
lying at Porto Bello, and should be glad if he could
keep her company till she was off the coast. That
she would sail in eight or ten days for the Havana;
and that, if his time would permit him, he would
send an advice-boat. That she had on board the
value of 800,000 pieces of eight in silver, and bar
gold. Misson returned answer, that he believed he
should be excused if he stretched his orders, for a
few days; and that he would cruise off the Isle of
Pearls, and Cape Gratias a Dios, and give for signal
to the galleon, his spreading a white ensign in his
fore-top-mast shrouds, the cluing up his fore-sail,
and the firing one gun to windward, and two to
leeward, which he should answer by hoisting his
fore-top-sail three times, and the firing as many
guns to leeward. Don Joseph, extremely pleased
with this complaisance, sent a boat express to advise
the St. Joseph, but she was already sailed two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>days, contrary to the governor of Carthagena’s expectation,
and this advice Capt. Misson had from
the boat, which returning with an answer, saw the
Victoire in the offing, and spoke to her. It was then
resolved to follow the St. Joseph, and accordingly
they steered for the Havanna, but by what accident
they did not overtake her is unknown.</p>

<p class='c000'>I forgot to tell my reader, that on board the
Dutch ship were fourteen French huguenots, whom
Misson thought fit to detain. When they were at
sea, he called them up, and proposed to them their
taking on; telling them at the same time, he left it
to their choice, for he would have no forced men;
and that if they all, or any of them disapproved the
proposal, he would either give them the first vessel
he met that was fit for them, or set them ashore on
some inhabited coast; and therefore bid them take
two days for consideration before they returned an
answer; and to encourage them, he called all
hands up, and declared, that if any man repented
of the course of life he had chosen, his just dividend
should be counted to him, and he would set him on
shore, either near the Havanna, or some other convenient
place; but not one accepted the offer, and
the fourteen prisoners unanimously resolved to join
in with them; to which resolution, no doubt, the
hopes of a good booty from the St. Joseph, and this
offer of liberty, greatly contributed.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the entrance of the Gulf they spied and came
up with a large merchant ship bound for London,
from Jamaica; she had 20 guns, but no more than
thirty-two hands, so that it is not to be wondered at
she made no resistance; besides, she was deep laden
with sugars. Mons. Misson took out of her what
ammunition she had, about four thousand pieces of
eight, some puncheons of rum, and ten hogsheads
of sugar; and, without doing her any further damage,
let her proceed her voyage. What he valued
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>most in this prize was the men he got, for she was
carrying to Europe twelve French prisoners, two
of which were necessary hands, being a carpenter
and his mate. They were of Bordeaux from
whence they came in the Pomechatraine, which
was taken by the Mermaid off Petit Guave, after an
obstinate resistance, in which they lost 40 men.
These men very willingly came into Capt. Misson’s
measures. Having been stripped to the skin, they
begged leave to make reprisals, but the captain
would not suffer them, though he told the master of
the prize, as he protected him and his men, he
thought it reasonable these French should be
clothed; upon this the master contributed of his
own, and every man bringing up his chest, thought
themselves very well off in sharing with them one
half.</p>

<p class='c000'>Though Misson’s ship passed for a French man
of war, yet his generosity in letting the prize go,
gave the English grounds to suspect the truth, neither
the ship nor cargo being of use to such as were
upon the grand account.</p>

<p class='c000'>When they had lost all hopes of the St. Joseph,
they coasted along the north side of Cuba, and the
Victoire growing now foul, they ran into a landlocked
bay on the E. N. E. point, where they hove
her down by boats and guns, though they could not
pretend to heave her keel out; however, they
scraped and tallowed as far as they could go; they,
for this reason, many of them, repented they had
let the last prize go, by which they might have careened.</p>

<p class='c000'>When they had righted the ship, and put every
thing on board, they consulted upon the course
they should steer. Upon this the council divided.
The captain and Caraccioli, were for stretching
over to the African, and the others for New-England
coast, alleging, that the ship had a foul
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>bottom, and was not fit for the voyage; and that if
they met with contrary winds, and bad weather,
their stock of provision might fall short; and that
as they were not far from the English settlement
of Carolina, they might either on that or on the coast
of Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New-York, or
New-England, intercept ships which traded to the
islands with provisions and by that means provide
themselves with bread, flour, and other necessaries.
An account of the provisions was taken, and finding
they had provisions for four months, Capt. Misson
called all hands upon deck, and told them, as
the council differed in the course they should steer,
he thought it reasonable to have it put to the vote
of the whole company. That for his part, he was
for going to the coast of Guinea, where they might
reasonably expect to meet with valuable prizes;
but should they fail in their expectation one way,
they would be sure of having it answered in another;
for they could then throw themselves in that
of East-India ships, and he need not tell them, that
the outward bound drained Europe of what money
they drew from America. He then gave the sentiments
of those who were against him, and their
reasons, and begged that every one would give his
opinion and vote according as he thought most
conducive to the good of all. That he should be
far from taking it ill if they should reject what he
had proposed, since he had no private views to
serve. The majority of votes fell on the captain’s
side, and they accordingly shaped their course for
the coast of Guinea, in which voyage nothing remarkable
happened. On their arrival on the gold
coast, they fell in with the Nieuwstadt, of Amsterdam,
a ship of 18 guns, commanded by Capt. Blaes,
who made a running fight of five glasses: this ship
they kept with them, putting on board 40 hands, and
bringing all the prisoners on board the Victoire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>they were forty-three in number; they left Amsterdam
with fifty-six: seven were killed in the engagement,
and they had lost six by sickness and
accidents, one falling overboard, and one being
taken by a shark, going overboard in a calm.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Nieuwstadt had some gold dust on board, to
the value of about £2000 sterling and a few slaves
to the number of seventeen, for she had but just
begun to trade; the slaves were a strengthening
of their hands, for the captain ordered them to be
clothed out of the Dutch mariners’ chests, and told
his men “That the trading for those of our own
species could never be agreeable to the eyes of
divine justice: that no man had power over the liberty
of another; and while those who professed
a more enlightened knowledge of the Deity, sold
men like beasts, they proved that their religion was
no more than grimace, and that they differed from
the barbarian in name only, since their practice
was in nothing more humane: for his part, and he
hoped he spoke the sentiments of all his brave
companions, he had not exempted his neck from
the galling yoke of slavery, and asserted his own
liberty to enslave others. That however these
men were distinguished from the Europeans by
their colour, customs, or religious rites, they were
the work of the same omnipotent Being, and indued
with equal reason, wherefore he desired they
might be treated like freemen, (for he would banish
even the name of slavery from among them) and
divided into messes among them, to the end they
might the sooner learn their language, be sensible
of the obligation they had to them, and more capable
and zealous to defend that liberty they owed
to their justice and humanity.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This speech of Misson’s was received with general
applause, and the ship rang with “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive le
Capitaine Misson</span></i>.” <em>Long live Capt. Misson.</em>—The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>negroes were divided among the French, one to a
mess, who, by their gesticulations showed they
were gratefully sensible of their being delivered
from their chains. Their ship growing very foul,
and going heavily through the water, they run into
the river Lagoa, where they hove her down,
taking out such planks as had suffered most by the
worms, and substituting new in their room.</p>

<p class='c000'>After this they careened the prize, and so put out
to sea, steering to the southward, and keeping
along the coast, but met with nothing. All this
while, the greatest decorum and regularity was observed
on board the Victoire; but the Dutch prisoners’
example began to lead them into swearing and
drunkenness, which the captain remarking thought
it was best to nip these vices in the bud; and calling
both the French and Dutch upon deck, he addressed
himself to the latter, desiring their captain, who
spoke French excellently well, to interpret what he
said to those who did not understand him. He told
them, “before he had the misfortune of having them
on board, his ears were never grated with hearing
the name of the great Creator profaned, though he,
to his sorrow, had often since heard his own men
guilty of that sin, which administered neither profit
nor<a id='t29'></a> pleasure, and might draw upon them a severe
punishment: that if they had a just idea of that
great Being, they would never mention him, but
they would immediately reflect on his purity and
their own vileness. That we so easily took impressions
from our company, that the Spanish proverb
says, <em>Let a hermit and a thief live together, the thief
would become hermit, or the hermit thief</em>, that he saw
this verified in his ship, for he could attribute the
oaths and curses he had heard among his brave companions,
to nothing but the odious example of the
Dutch: that this was not the only vice they had introduced,
for before they were on board, his men
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>were men, but he found by their beastly pattern
they were degenerated into brutes, by drowning
that only faculty which distinguishes between men
and beasts, <em>reason</em>. That as he had the honour to
command them, he could not see them run into
these odious vices without a sincere concern, as he
had a paternal affection for them; and he should reproach
himself as neglectful of the common good,
if he did not admonish them; and as by the post
with which they had honoured him, he was obliged
to have a watchful eye over their general interest;
he was obliged to tell them his sentiments were,
that the Dutch allured them to a dissolute way of
life, that they might take some advantage over
them: wherefore, as his brave companions, he was
assured, would be guided by reason, he gave the
Dutch notice, that the first whom he caught either
with an oath in his mouth or liquor in his head,
should be brought to the geers, whipped and pickled
for an example to the rest of his nation; as to his
friends, his companions, his children, those gallant,
those generous, noble, and heroic souls he
had the honour to command, he entreated them to
allow a small time for reflection, and to consider
how little pleasure and how much danger, might
flow from imitating the vices of their enemies; and
that they would among themselves, make a law for
the suppression of what would otherwise estrange
them from the source of life, and consequently
leave them destitute of his protection.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It is not to be imagined what efficacy this speech
had on both nations; the Dutch grew continent in
fear of punishment, and the French in fear of being
reproached by their good captain, for they never
mentioned him without this epithet. Upon the
coast of Angola, they met with a second Dutch
ship, the cargo of which consisted of silk and woollen
stuffs, cloth, lace, wine, brandy, oil, spice, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>hardware: the prize gave chase and engaged her,
but upon the coming up of the Victoire she struck.
This ship opportunely came in their way, and gave
full employ to the tailors, who were on board; for
the whole crew began to be out at elbows; they
plundered her of what was of use to their own ship,
and then sunk her.</p>

<p class='c000'>The captain having about ninety prisoners on
board, proposed the giving them the prize with
what was necessary for their voyage, and sending
them away; which being agreed to, they shifted
her ammunition on board the Victoire, and giving
them provisions to carry them to the settlements
the Dutch have on the coast, Misson called them
up, told them what was his design, and asked if any
of them was willing to share his fortune: eleven
Dutch came in to him, two of whom were sailmakers,
one an armourer, and one a carpenter,
necessary hands; the rest he let go, not a little
surprised at the regularity, tranquility, and humanity,
which they found among these new
fashioned pirates.</p>

<p class='c000'>They had now run the length of Saldanha bay,
about ten leagues to the northward of Table Bay.
As here is good water, safe riding, plenty of fish
and fresh provision, to be got of the natives for the
merchandise they had on board, it was resolved to
stay here some little time for refreshments. When
they had the bay open, they spied a tall ship, which
instantly got under sail, and hove out English colours.
The Victoire made clear ship, and hove out
her French ensign, and a smart engagement began.
The English was a new ship built for 40 guns, though
she had but 32 mounted, and 90 hands. Misson
gave orders for boarding, and the number of fresh
men he constantly poured in, after an obstinate dispute
obliged the English to fly the decks, and leave
the French masters of their ship, who promised,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>and gave them good quarters and stripped not
a man.</p>

<p class='c000'>They found on board the prize some bales of
English broadcloth, and about £60,000 in English
crown pieces, and Spanish pieces of eight. The
English captain was killed in the engagement, and
14 of his men: the French lost 12, which was no
small mortification, but did not however provoke
them to use their prisoners harshly. Capt. Misson
was sorry for the death of the commander, whom
he buried on shore, and one of his men being a
stone-cutter, he raised a stone over his grave with
these words, “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Icy gist un brave Anglois</span></i>,” <em>Here lies
a gallant Englishman</em>. When he was buried he
made a triple discharge of fifty small arms, and
fired minute guns.</p>

<p class='c000'>The English, knowing whose hands they were
fallen into, and charmed with Misson’s humanity,
30 of them, in three days space, desired to take on
with him. He accepted them, but at the same time
gave them to understand, that in taking on with
him they were not to expect they should be indulged
in a dissolute and immoral life. He now divided
his company between the two ships, and made Caraccioli
captain of the prize, giving him officers
chosen by the public suffrage. The 17 negroes began
to understand a little French, and to be useful
hands, and in less than a month all the English prisoners
came over to him, except their officers.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had two ships well manned with resolute fellows:
they now doubled the cape, and made the
S. end of Madagascar, and one of the Englishmen
telling Capt. Misson, that the European ships bound
for Surat, commonly touched at the island of Johanna,
he sent for Capt. Caraccioli on board, and it was
agreed to cruise off that island. They accordingly
sailed on the West side of Madagascar, and off the
bay de Diego. About half seas over, between that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>bay, and the island of Johanna, they came up with
an English East-Indiaman, which made signals of
distress as soon as she spied Misson and his prize,
they found her sinking by an unexpected leak, and
took all her men on board, though they could get
little out of her before she went down. The English,
who were thus miraculously saved from perishing,
desired to be set on shore at Johanna,
where they hoped to meet with either a Dutch or
English ship in a little time, and the mean while
they were sure of relief.</p>

<p class='c000'>They arrived at Johanna, and were kindly received
by the Queen Regent and her brother, on
account of the English on the one hand, and of
their strength on the other, which the queen’s brother,
who had the administration of affairs, was not
able to make head against, and hoped they might
assist him against the king of Mohila, who threatened
him with a visit.</p>

<p class='c000'>This is an island which is contiguous, in a manner,
to Johanna, and lies about N. W. by N. from it.
Caraccioli told Misson he might take his advantage
in widening the breach between these two little
monarchies, and, by offering his assistance to that
of Johanna, in a manner rule both, for these would
court him as their protector, and those come to any
terms to buy his friendship, by which means he
would hold the balance of power between them.
He followed this advice, and offered his friendship
and assistance to the queen, who very readily embraced
it.</p>

<p class='c000'>I must advise the reader, that many of this island
speak English, and that the Englishmen who were
of Misson’s crew, and his interpreters, told them,
their captain, though not an Englishman, was their
friend and ally, and a friend and brother to the Johanna men,
for they esteemed the English beyond
all other nations.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>They were supplied by the queen with all necessaries
of life, and Misson married her sister, as Caraccioli
did the daughter of her brother, whose armoury,
which consisted before of no more than two
rusty fire-locks and three pistols, he furnished with
30 fuzils, as many pair of pistols, and gave him two
barrels of powder and four of ball.</p>

<p class='c000'>Several of his men took wives, and some required
their share of the prizes, which was justly given
them, they designing to settle in this island; but the
number of these did not exceed ten, which loss was
repaired by thirty of the crew (they had saved from
perishing) coming in to him.</p>

<p class='c000'>While they past their time in all manner of diversions
the place would afford them, as hunting,
feasting, and visiting the island, the king of Mohila,
made a descent, and alarmed the whole country.
Misson advised the queen’s brother not to give him
any impediment but let him get into the heart of the
island, and he would take care to intercept their
return; but the prince answered, should he follow
this advice the enemy would do him and his subjects
an irreparable damage, in destroying the cocoa
walks, and for that reason he must endeavour
to stop his progress. Upon this answer he asked the
English who were not under his command, if they
were willing to join him in repelling the enemies of
their common host, and one and all consenting, he
gave them arms, and mixed them with his own men,
and about the same number of Johannians, under
the command of Caraccioli and the queen’s brother,
and arming out all his boats, he went himself to the
westward of the island, where they made their descent.
The party which went by land, fell in with,
and beat the Mohilians with great ease, who were
in the greatest consternation, to find their retreat
cut off by Misson’s boats. The Johannians, whom
they had often molested, were so enraged, that they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>gave quarter to none, and out of 300 who made the
descent, if Misson and Caraccioli had not interposed,
not a soul had escaped; 113 were taken prisoners,
by his men, and carried on board his ships.
These he sent safe to Mohila, with a message to the
king, to desire he would make peace with his friend
and ally the king of Johanna; but that prince, little
affected with the service done him in the preservation
of his subjects, sent him word he took laws from
none, and knew when to make war and peace without
his advice, which he neither asked nor wanted.
Misson irritated by this rude answer, resolved to
transfer the war into his own country, and accordingly
set sail for Mohila, with about 100 Johanna
men. The shore on sight of the ships, was filled
with men to hinder a descent if intended, but the
great guns soon dispersed this rabble, and under
their cover he landed the Johannians, and an equal
number of French and English. They were met
by about 700 Mohilians, who pretended to stop their
passage, but their darts and arrows were of little
avail against Misson’s fuzils; the first discharge
made a great slaughter, and about 20 shells which
were thrown among them, put them to a confused
flight. The party of Europeans and Johannians
then marched to their metropolis, without resistance,
which they reduced to ashes, and the Johannians
cut down all the cocoa walks that they could
for the time, for towards evening they returned to
their ships, and stood off to sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>At their return to Johanna the queen made a festival,
and magnified the bravery and service of her
guests, friends, and allies. This feast lasted four
days, at the expiration of which time the queen’s
brother proposed to Capt. Misson the making another
descent, in which he would go in person, and
did not doubt subjecting the Mohilians; but this
was not the design of Misson, who had thoughts of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>fixing a retreat on the N. W. side of Madagascar,
and looked upon the feuds between these two
islands advantageous to his views, and therefore no
way his interest to suffer the one to overcome the
other; for while the variance was kept up, and their
forces pretty much upon a level, it was evident
their interest would make both sides caress him; he
therefore answered, that they ought to deliberate
on the consequences, for they might be deceived
in their hopes, and find the conquest less easy than
they imagined. That the king of Mohila would be
more upon his guard, and not only intrench himself,
but gall them with frequent ambuscades, by which
they must inevitably lose a number of men; and, if
they were forced to retire with loss, raise the courage
of the Mohilians, and make them irreconcilable
enemies to the Johannians, and entirely deprive him
of the advantages with which he might now make a
peace, having twice defeated them: that he could
not be always with them, and at his leaving Johanna
he might expect the king of Mohila would
endeavour to take a bloody revenge for the late
damages. The queen gave entirely into Misson’s
sentiments.</p>

<p class='c000'>While this was in agitation, four Mohilians arrived
as ambassadors to propose a peace. Finding
the Johannians upon high terms, one of them
spoke to this purpose:—<em>O ye Johannians, do not
conclude from you late success, that fortune will be
always favourable; she will not always give you the
protection of the Europeans, and without their help it
is possible you might now sue for a peace, which you
seem averse to. Remember the sun rises, comes to its
meridian height, and stays not there, but declines in
a moment. Let this admonish you to reflect on the
constant revolution of all sublunary affairs, and the
greater is your glory, the nearer you are to your
declension. We are taught by every thing we see,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>that there is no stability in the world, but nature is
in continual movement. The sea, which overflows
the sands, has its bounds set, which it cannot pass,
which the moment it has reached, without abiding, returns
back to the bosom of the deep. Every herb,
every shrub and tree, and even our own bodies teach us
this lesson, that nothing is durable, or can be counted
upon. Time passes away insensibly, one sun follows
another, and brings its changes with it. To-day’s
globe of light sees you strengthened by these Europeans
elate with victory, and we, who have been used to
conquer you, come to ask a peace. To-morrow’s sun
may see you deprived of your present succours, and
the Johannians petitioning us: as therefore we cannot
say what to-morrow may bring forth, it would be
unwise on uncertain hopes to forego a certain advantage,
as surely peace ought to be esteemed by every
wise man.</em></p>

<p class='c000'>Having said this, the ambassadors withdraw,
and were treated by the queen’s orders. After the
council had concluded, they were again called upon,
and the queen told them, that by the advice of
her good friends, the Europeans, and those of her
council, she agreed to make peace, which she
wished might banish all memory of former injuries;
that they must own the war was begun by them,
and that she was far from being the aggressor;
she only defended herself in her own kingdom,
which they had often invaded, though, till within a
few days, she had never molested their coasts. If
then they really desired to live amicably with her,
they must resolve to send two of the king’s children,
and ten of the first nobility, as hostages: that
they might, when they pleased, return, for these
were the only terms on which she would desist
prosecuting the advantages she now had, with
the utmost vigour.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ambassadors returned with this answer, and,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>about ten days after, the two ships appearing upon
their coasts, they sent off to give notice, that their
king complied with the terms proposed, would send
the hostages, and desired a cessation of all hostility,
and, at the same time, invited the commanders on
shore. The Johanna men on board dissuaded their
accepting the invitation; but Misson and Caraccioli,
fearing nothing, went, but armed their boat’s crew.
They were received by the king with demonstrations
of friendship, and they dined with him under a
tamarind tree; but when they parted from him, and
were returning to their boats, they were inclosed by
at least a hundred of the Mohilians, who set upon
them with the utmost fury, and, in the first flight of
arrows, wounded both the captains, and killed four
of their boat’s crew, of eight who were with them.
They, in return, discharged their pistols with some
execution, and fell in with their cutlasses; but all
their bravery would have stood them in little stead,
had not the report of their pistols alarmed and
brought the rest of their friends to their assistance,
who took their fuzils, and coming up while they
were engaged, discharged a volley on the back of
the assailants, which laid twelve of them dead on
the spot. The ships hearing this fire, sent immediately
the yawls and long-boats well manned.
Though the islanders were a little damped in their
courage by this fire of the boat’s crew, yet they did
not give over the fight, and one of them desperately
threw himself upon Caraccioli, and gave him a deep
wound in the side with a long knife; but he paid for
the rashness of the attempt with his life, one of the
crew cleaving his scull. The yawls and long-boats
now arrived, and being guided by the noise, reinforced
their companions, put the traitors to flight,
and brought off their dead and wounded. The
Europeans lost by this treachery, seven slain outright,
and eight wounded, six of which recovered.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>The crew were resolved to revenge the blood of
their officers and comrades the next day, and were
accordingly on the point of landing, when two
canoes came off with two men bound, the pretended
authors of this treason, without the king’s knowledge,
who had sent them that they might receive
the punishment due to their villany. The Johanna
men on board were called for interpreters, who
having given this account, added, that the king
only sacrificed these men, but that they should not
believe him, for he certainly had given orders for assassinating
the Europeans; and the better way was
to kill all the Mohilians that came in the canoes,
as well as the two prisoners; go back to Johanna,
take more of their countrymen, and give no peace
to traitors; but Misson was for no such violent
measures; he was averse to every thing that bore
the face of cruelty, and thought a bloody revenge,
if necessity did not enforce it, spoke a grovelling
and timid soul: he, therefore, sent those of the
canoes back, and bid them tell their king, if before
the evening he sent the hostages agreed upon, he
should give credit to his excuse; but if he did not,
he should believe him the author of the late vile
attempt on his life.</p>

<p class='c000'>The canoes went off, but returned not with an
answer; wherefore, he bid the Johanna men tell
the two prisoners that they should be set on shore
the next morning, and ordered them to acquaint
their king, he was no executioner to put those to
death whom he had condemned, but that he should
find he knew how to revenge himself of his treason.
The prisoners being unbound, threw themselves
at his feet, and begged that he would not
send them ashore, for they should be surely put to
death, for the crime they had committed, was, the
dissuading the barbarous action of which they
were accused as authors.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>Next day, the two ships landed 200 men, under
the cover of their cannon; but that precaution of
bringing their ships close to the shore, they found
needless: not a soul appearing, they marched two
leagues up the country, when they saw a body of
men appear behind some shrubs. Caraccioli’s lieutenant,
who commanded the right wing, with fifty
men, made up to them, but found he had got among
pit-falls artificially covered, several of his men falling
into them, which made him halt, and not pursue
those Mohilians who made a feint retreat to ensnare
him, thinking it dangerous to proceed farther; and
seeing no enemy would face them, they retired the
same way they came, and getting into their boats,
went on board the ships, resolving to return with
a strong reinforcement, and make descents at one
and the same time in different parts of the island.
They asked the two prisoners how the country lay,
and what the soil was on the north side of the
island; and they answered it was morass, and the
most dangerous part to attempt, it being a place
where they shelter on any imminent danger.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ships returned to Johanna, where the greatest
tenderness and care was shown for the recovery
and cure of the two captains and of their men;
they lay six weeks before they were able to walk
the decks, for neither of them would quit his ship.
Their Johanna wives expressed a concern they did
not think them capable of; nay, a wife of one of the
wounded men who died, stood some time looking
upon the corpse as motionless as a statue, then
embracing it, without shedding a tear, desired she
might take it ashore to wash and bury it; and at
the same time by an interpreter, and with a little
mixture of European language, begged her late
husband’s friends would take their leave of him
the next day.</p>

<p class='c000'>Accordingly a number went ashore, and carried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>with them the dividend, which fell to his share,
which the captain ordered to be given to his widow;
when she saw the money, she smiled, and
asked if all that was for her?—Being answered in
the affirmative, “and what good will all that shining
dirt do me? If I could with it purchase the life
of my husband, and call him back from the grave, I
would accept it with pleasure, but as it is not sufficient
to allure him back to this world, I have no use
for it; do with it what you please.” Then she desired
they would go with her and perform the last
ceremonies to her husband’s dead body, after their
country fashion, lest he should be displeased; that
she could not stay with them, to be a witness, because
she was in haste to go and be married again.
She startled the Europeans who heard this latter
part of her speech, so dissonant from the beginning;
however they followed her, and she led them
into a plantain walk, where they found a great many
Johanna men and women, sitting under the
shade of plantains, round the corpse, which lay
(as they all sat) on the ground, covered with flowers.
She embraced them round, and then the
Europeans, one by one, and after these ceremonies,
she poured out a number of bitter imprecations
against the Mohila men, whose treachery
had darkened her husband’s eyes, and made him
insensible of her caresses, who was her first love,
to whom she had given her heart with her virginity.
She then proceeded in his praises, calling
him the joy of infants, the love of virgins, the delight
of the old, and the wonder of the young,
adding, he was strong and beautiful as the cedar,
brave as the bull, tender as the kid, and loving as
the ground turtle. Having finished this oration,
not unlike those of the Romans, which the nearest
relation of the deceased used to pronounce from
the rostrum, she laid down by the side of her husband,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>embracing him, and sitting up again, gave
herself a deep wound under the left breast with a
bayonet, and fell dead on her husband’s corpse.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Europeans were astonished at the tenderness
and the resolution of the girl, for she was not,
by what her mien spoke her, past seventeen; and
they now admired, as much as they had secretly
detested her, for saying she was in haste to be married
again, the meaning of which they did not
understand.</p>

<p class='c000'>After the husband and wife were buried, the
crew returned on board, and gave an account of
what had passed; the captains’ wives (for Misson
and his were on board the Bijoux, the name they
had given their prize from her make and gilding)
seemed not in the least surprised, and Caraccioli’s
lady only said, she must be of noble descent, for
none but the families of the nobility had the privilege
allowed them of following their husbands, on
pain if they transgressed, of being thrown into the
sea, to be eat by fish; and they knew that their souls
could not rest as long as any of the fish, who fed upon
them, lived. Misson asked, if they intended to
have done the same thing had they died? “We
should not,” answered his wife, “have disgraced
our families; nor is our tenderness for our husbands
inferior to hers whom you seem to admire.”</p>

<p class='c000'>After their recovery, Misson proposed a cruise,
on the coast of Zanguebar, which being agreed to,
he and Caraccioli, took leave of the queen and her
brother, and would have left their wives on the
island, but they could by no means be induced to
the separation; it was in vain to urge the shortness
of the time they were to cruise; they answered it
was not farther than Mohila they intended to go,
and if they were miserable in that short absence,
they could never support a longer; and if they
would not allow them to keep them company in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>voyage, they must not expect to see them at their
return, if they intended one.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a word, they were obliged to yield to them, but
told them, if the views of their men should insist as
strongly on following their example, their tenderness
would be their ruin, and make them a prey to
their enemies; they answered, the queen should
prevent that, by ordering that no woman should go
on board, and if any were in the ships, they should
return on shore: this order was accordingly made,
and they set sail for the river Mozambique. In
about ten days’ cruise after they had left Johanna,
and about 15 leagues to the eastward of this river,
they fell in with a stout Portuguese ship of 60 guns,
which engaged them from break of day till two in
the afternoon, when the captain being killed, and a
great number of men lost, she struck; this proved a
very rich prize, for she had the value of £250,000
sterling on board, in gold dust. The two women
never quit the decks all the time of the engagement,
neither gave they the least mark of fear except for
their husbands. This engagement cost them 30
men, and Caraccioli lost his right leg; the slaughter
fell mostly on the English, for of the above number,
20 were of that nation: the Portuguese lost double
the number. Caraccioli’s wound made them resolve
to make the best of their way for Johanna,
where the greatest care was taken of their wounded,
not one of whom died, though their number
amounted to 27.</p>

<p class='c000'>Caraccioli kept his bed two months; but Misson
seeing him in a fair way of recovery, took what
hands could be spared from the Bijoux, leaving her
sufficient for defence, and went out, having mounted
ten of the Portuguese guns, for he had hitherto
carried but thirty, though he had ports for forty.
He stretched over to Madagascar, and coasted
along this island to the northward, as far as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>most northerly point, when turning back, he entered
a bay to the northward of Diego Suares. He run ten
leagues up this bay, and on the larboard side found
it afforded a large, and safe harbour, with plenty of
fresh water. He came to an anchor, went on shore
and examined the nature of the soil, which he found
rich, the air wholesome, and the country level. He
told his men this was an excellent place for an asylum,
and that he determined here to fortify and
raise a small town, and make docks for shipping,
that they might have some place to call their own;
and a receptacle, when age or wounds had rendered
them incapable of hardship, where they might
enjoy the fruits of their labour, and go to their
graves in peace: that he would not, however, set
about this, till he had the approbation of the whole
company; and were he sure they would all approve
this design, which he hoped, it being evidently for
the general good, he should not think it advisable
to begin any works, lest the natives should, in his
absence, destroy them; but, however, as they had
nothing upon their hands, if they were of his opinion,
they might begin to fall and square timber, ready
for the raising a wooden fort, when they returned
with their companions.</p>

<p class='c000'>The captain’s motion was universally applauded,
and in ten days they felled and rough hewed a
hundred and fifty large trees, without any interruption
from or seeing any of the inhabitants. They
felled their timber at the waters’ edge, so that they
had not the trouble of hauling them any way, which
would have employed a great deal more time: they
returned again, and acquainted their companions
with what they had seen and done, and with the
captain’s resolution, which they one and all came
into.</p>

<p class='c000'>Capt. Misson then told the queen, as he had been
serviceable to her in her war with the island of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>Mohila, and might continue to be of farther use, he
did not question her lending him assistance in the
settling himself on the coast of Madagascar, and to
that end furnish him with 300 men, to help in his
buildings. The queen answered, she could do
nothing without consent of council, and that she
would assemble her nobility, and did not question
their agreeing to anything he could reasonably desire,
for they were sensible of the obligations the
Johannians had to him. The council was accordingly
called, and Misson’s demand being told, one
of the eldest said, he did not think it expedient to
comply with it, nor safe to refuse; that they should
in agreeing to give him that assistance, help to
raise a power, which might prove formidable to
themselves, by the being so near a neighbour; and
these men who had lately protected, might, when
they found it for their interest, enslave them. On
the other hand, if they did not comply, they had the
power to do them great damage: that they were
to make choice of the least of two possible evils,
for he could prognosticate no good to Johanna,
by their settling near it. Another answered, that
many of them had Johanna wives: that it was not
likely they would make enemies of the Johanna
men at the first settling, because their friendship
might be of use to them; and from their children
there was nothing to be apprehended in the next
generation, for they would be half their own blood;
that in the mean while, if they complied with the
request, they might be sure of an ally and protector
against the king of Mohila; wherefore, he was for
agreeing to the demand.</p>

<p class='c000'>After a long debate, in which every inconvenience
and advantage was maturely considered, it
was agreed to send with him the number of men he
required, on condition he should send them back in
four moons, make an alliance with them, and war
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>against Mohila. This being agreed to, they staid
till Caraccioli was thoroughly recovered: then putting
the Johannians on board the Portuguese ship,
with forty French and English, and fifteen Portuguese
to work her, and setting sail, they arrived at
the place where Misson designed his settlement,
which he called <em>Libertatia</em>, and gave the name of
<em>Liberi</em> to his people, desiring in that might be
drowned the distinguished names of French, English,
Dutch, Africans, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first thing they set about was, the raising a
fort on each side the harbour, which they made of
an octagon figure, and having finished and mounted
them with forty guns taken out of the Portuguese,
they raised a battery on an angle, of ten guns, and
began to raise houses and magazines under the
protection of their forts and ships; the Portuguese
was unrigged, and all her sails and cordage carefully
laid up. While they were very busily employed
in the raising a town, a party which had often hunted
and rambled four or five leagues off their settlement,
resolved to venture farther into the country.
They made themselves some huts, at about
four leagues distance from their companions, and
travelled E. S. E. about five leagues farther into
the country, when they came up with a black, who
was armed with a bow, arrows, and a javelin: they
with a friendly appearance engaged the fellow to
lay by his fear, and go with them. They carried
him to their companions, and there entertained
him three days with a great deal of humanity, and
then returned with him near the place they found
him, and made him a present of a piece of scarlet
baize, and an axe. He appeared overjoyed with
the present, and left them with seeming satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c000'>The hunters imagined that there might be some
village not far off, and observing that he looked at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>the sun, and then took his way directly south, they
travelled on the same point of the compass, and
from the top of a hill they spied a pretty large
village, and went down to it: the men came out
with their arms, such as before described, bows,
arrows, and javelins; but upon two only of the
whites advancing, with presents of axes and baize
in their hands, they sent only four to meet them.
The misfortune was, that they could not understand
one another: but by their pointing to the sun,
and holding up one finger, and making one of them
go forward, and return again with showing their
circumcision, and pointing up to heaven with one
finger, they apprehended they gave them to understand
there was but one God, who had sent one
prophet, and concluded from thence, and their circumcision,
they were Mahometans. The presents
were carried to their chief, and he seemed to receive
them kindly, and by signs invited the whites
into their village; but they remembering the late
treachery of the Mohilians, made signs for victuals
to be brought to them where they were.</p>

  <h3 id='BOWEN' class='c007'>CAPTAIN JOHN BOWEN.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The exact time of this person’s setting out I am
not certain of. I find him cruising on the Malabar
coast in the year 1700, commanding a ship called
the Speaker, whose crew consisted of men of all nations,
and their piracies were committed upon ships
of all nations likewise. The pirates here met with
no manner of inconveniencies in carrying on their
designs, for it was made so much a trade, that the
merchants of one town never scrupled the buying
commodities taken from another, though but ten
miles distant, in a public sale, furnishing the robbers
at the same time with all necessaries, even of
vessels, when they had occasion to go on any expedition,
which they themselves would often advise
them of.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the rest, an English East-Indiaman, Capt.
Coneway, from Bengal, fell into the hands of this
crew, which they made prize of, near Callequilon.
They carried her in, and put her up to sale, dividing
the ship and cargo into three shares; one third
was sold to a merchant, native of Callequilon aforesaid,
another third to a merchant of Porca, and the
other to one Malpa, a Dutch factor.</p>

<p class='c000'>Loaded with the spoil of this and several country
ships they left the coast, and steered for Madagascar;
but in their voyage thither, meeting with adverse
winds, and, being negligent in their steerage,
they ran upon St. Thomas’s reef, at the island of
Mauritius, where the ship was lost; but Bowen and
the greatest part of the crew got safe ashore.</p>

<p class='c000'>They met here with all the civility and good
treatment imaginable. Bowen was complimented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>in a particular manner by the governor, and splendidly
entertained in his house; the sick men were
got, with great care, into the fort, and cured by
their doctor, and no supplies of any sort, wanting
for the rest. They spent here three months, but yet
resolving to set down at Madagascar, they bought
a sloop, which they converted into a brigantine,
and about the middle of March, 1701, departed,
having first taken formal leave of the governor, by
making a present of 2500 pieces of eight; leaving
him, besides, the wreck of their ship, with the guns,
stores, and every thing else that was saved. The
governor, on his part, supplied them with necessaries
for their voyage, which was but short, and gave
them a kind invitation to make that island a place
of refreshment in the course of their future adventures,
promising that nothing should be wanting to
them that his government afforded.</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon their arrival at Madagascar, they put in at
a place on the east side, called Maritan, quit their
vessel, and settled themselves ashore in a fruitful
plain on the side of a river. They built themselves
a fort on the river’s mouth, towards the sea, and
another small one on the other side, towards the
country; the first to prevent a surprise from shipping,
and the other as a security from the natives,
many of whom they employed in the building.
They built also a little town for their habitation,
which took up the remainder of the year 1701.</p>

<p class='c000'>When this was done, they soon became dissatisfied
with their new situation, having a hankering
mind after their old employment, and accordingly
resolved to fit up the brigantine they had from the
Dutch at Mauritius, which was laid in a cove near
their settlement; but an accident, that they improved,
provided for them in a better manner, and
saved them a great deal of trouble.</p>

<p class='c000'>It happened that about the beginning of the year
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>1702, a ship called the Speedy Return, belonging
to the Scotch-African and East-India company,
Capt. Drummond, commander, came into the port
of Maritan in Madagascar, with a brigantine that
belonged to her; they had before taken in negroes
at St. Mary’s, a little island adjoining to the main
land of Madagascar, and carried them to Don Mascarenhas,
from whence they sailed to this port on
the same trade.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the ship’s arrival, Capt. Drummond, with Andrew
Wilky, his surgeon, and several others of the
crew, went on shore; in the mean time John Bowen,
with four others of his consorts, went off in a
little boat, on pretence of buying some of their merchandise
brought from Europe: and finding a fair
opportunity, the chief mate, boatswain, and a hand
or two more only upon deck, and the rest at work
in the hold they threw off their mask; each drew
out a pistol and hanger, and told them they were
all dead men if they did not retire that moment
to the cabin. The surprise was sudden, and they
thought it necessary to obey: one of the pirates
placed himself sentry at the door, with his arms in
his hands, and the rest immediately laid the hatches,
and then made a signal to their fellows on
shore as agreed on; upon which, about forty or fifty
came on board, and took quiet possession of the
ship, and afterwards the brigantine, without bloodshed,
or striking a stroke. Bowen was made, or
rather made himself, of course, captain; he detained
the old crew, or the greatest part thereof, burnt
the Dutch brigantine as being of no use to them,
cleaned and fitted the ship, took water, provisions,
and what necessaries were wanting, and made ready
for new adventures.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having thus piratically possessed himself of
Capt. Drummond’s ship and brigantine, and being
informed by the crew, that when they left Don Mascarenhas,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>a ship called the Rook galley, Capt. Honeycomb,
commander, was lying in that bay, Bowen
resolved, with the other pirates, to sail thither, but
it taking up seven or eight days in watering their
vessels, and settling their private affairs, they arrived
not at the island till after the departure of the
said galley, who thereby happily escaped the villaneous
snare of their unprovoked enemies.</p>

<p class='c000'>The night after the pirates left Maritan, the brigantine
ran on a ledge of rocks off the west side of
the island of Madagascar, which not being perceived
by the ship, Bowen came into Mascarenhas without
her, not knowing what was become of his consort.
Here he stayed eight or ten days, in which time he
supplied the ship with provisions, and judging that
the Rook galley was gone to some other island, the
ship sailed to Mauritius, in search of her; but the
pirates seeing four or five ships in the N. W. harbour,
they thought themselves too weak to attempt
any thing there; so they stood immediately for
Madagascar again, and arrived safe, first at Port
Dauphin and then at Augustin Bay. In a few days
the Content brigantine, which they supposed either
to have been lost, or revolted that honourable service,
came into the same bay, and informed their
brethren of the misfortune that happened to them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The rogues were glad, no doubt, of seeing one
another again, and calling a council together, they
found the brigantine in no condition for business,
being then very leaky; therefore she was condemned,
and forthwith hauled ashore and burnt,
and the crew united, and all went on board the
Speedy Return.</p>

<p class='c000'>At this place the pirates were made acquainted,
by the negroes, of the adventures of another gang
that had settled for some time near that harbour,
and had one Howard for their captain. It was the
misfortune of an India ship called the Prosperous,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>to come into the bay at the time that these rogues
were looking out for employment; who under the
pretence of trading (almost in the same manner that
Bowen and his gang had seized the Speedy Return)
made themselves master of her, and sailed with
her to New Mathelage. Bowen and his gang consulting
together on this intelligence, concluded it
was more for their interest to join in alliance with
this new company, than to act single, they being too
weak of themselves to undertake any considerable
enterprise, remembering how they were obliged to
bear away from the island of Mauritius, when they
were in search of the Rook galley, which they might
have taken, with several others, had they had, at
that time, a consort of equal force to their own ship.</p>

<p class='c000'>They accordingly set sail from the bay, and came
into New Mathelage, but found no ship there,
though upon enquiry they understood that the pirate
they looked for, had been at the place, but was
gone; so after some stay they proceeded to Johanna,
but the Prosperous not being there neither,
they sailed to Mayotta, where they found her lying
at anchor. This was about Christmas, 1702.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here these two powers struck up an alliance.
Howard liking the proposals, came readily into it,
and the treaty was ratified by both companies.
They stayed about two months at this island,
thinking it, perhaps, as likely a place to meet with
prey as cruising out for it, and so indeed it happened;
for about the beginning of March, the ship
Pembroke, belonging to our East-India company,
coming in for water, was boarded by their boats,
and taken, with the loss of the chief mate and another
man that were killed in the skirmish.</p>

<p class='c000'>The two pirate ships weighed, and went out to
sea along with their prize, and that day and the
next plundered her of the best part of her cargo,
provisions, and stores, and then taking the captain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>and carpenter away, they let the Pembroke go
where the remainder of her crew pleased, and came
with their ships into New Mathelage. Here the
two captains consulted, and laid a plan for a cruise
to India, for which purpose they detained Capt.
Woolley, of the Pembroke, lately taken, in order to
be their pilot in those seas; but a very hot dispute
arose between the two companies which ship he
should go aboard of, insomuch that they had gone
together by the ears, if an expedient had not been
found to satisfy each party, that one might not have
the advantage of the other by the captain’s skill
and knowledge of the Indian coast, and this was to
knock the poor man on the head, and murder him:
but at last, by the authority of Bowen, Capt. Woolley
escaped the threatened danger, by bringing his
company to consent to his remaining on board the
Prosperous, where he then was.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Speedy Return being foul, and wanting a
little repair was judged proper for her to go back
to Augustin Bay to clean; in the mean while the
Prosperous was to have a pair of boot-tops where
she lay, and likewise to take in water and provisions,
and then to join their consort again at Mayotta,
the island appointed for the rendezvous.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prosperous put into Mayotta as agreed on,
and waiting there some time for Bowen’s ship, without
seeing or hearing any news of her, went to Johanna,
but not meeting with her there, they apprehended
some accident had befell her, and therefore
left the place, and sailed on the expedition themselves.
As to the Speedy Return, she arrived safe
at St. Augustin Bay, at Madagascar, and there
cleaned and victualled; but tarrying there somewhat
too long, the winds hung contrary, and they
could not for their lives beat up to Mayotta, and
therefore went up to Johanna, where, hearing that
their friends had lately left that Island, they steered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>for the Red Sea, but the wind not proving fair for
their design, they bore away for the high land of
St. John’s near Surat, where they once more fell
in company with their brethren of the Prosperous.</p>

<p class='c000'>They cruised together as was first agreed on,
and after some time they had sight of four ships,
to which they gave chase; but these separating,
two standing to the northward, and two to the
southward, the pirates separated likewise, Bowen
standing after those that steered southerly, and
Howard crowding after the others. Bowen came up
with the heaviest of the two, which proved to be a
Moorish ship of 700 tons, bound from the Gulf of
Mocha to Surat. The pirates brought the prize into
Rajapora, on the coast of India, where they plundered
her; the merchandise they sold to the natives,
but a small sum of current gold they found
aboard, amounting to £22,000 English money, they
put into their pockets. Two days after, the Prosperous
came in, but without any prize; however,
they soon made their friends acquainted that they
had not succeeded worse than themselves, for at
Surat river’s mouth, where all the four ships were
bound, they came up with their chase, and with a
broad side, one of them struck, but the other got
into the bay. They stood down the coast with the
prize till they had plundered her of the best of her
cargo, the most valuable of which was 84,000 sequins,
a piece of about ten shillings each, and then
they left her adrift, without either anchor or cable,
off Daman.</p>

<p class='c000'>While they were lying at Rajapora they passed a
survey on their shipping, and judging their own to
be less serviceable than their prize, they voted them
to the flames, and straightway fitted up the Surat
ship. They transported both companies aboard of
her, and then set fire to the Prosperous and Speedy
Return. They mustered at this place 164 fighting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>men; 43 only were English, the greater number
French, the rest Danes, Swedes, and Dutch. They
took on board 70 Indians to do the drudgery of the
ship, and mounted 56 guns, calling her the Defiance,
and sailed from Rajapora the latter end of October,
in the year 1703 to cruise on the coast of Malabar.
But not meeting with prey in this first cruise, they
came to an anchor about three leagues to the
northward of Cochen, expecting some boats to come
off with supplies of refreshments, for which purpose
they fired several guns, by way of signal, but none
appearing, the quarter-master was sent in the pinnace
to confer with the people, which he did with
some caution, keeping the boat upon their oars at
the shore side. In short, they agreed very well,
the pirates were promised whatever necessaries
they wanted, and the boat returned aboard.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next day a boat came off from the town
with hogs, goats, wine, &amp;c. with a private intimation
from Malpa, the Dutch broker, an old friend of
the pirates, that a ship of that country called the
Rhimæ, lay then in Mudbay, not many leagues off,
and if they would go out and take her, he would
purchase the cargo of them, and likewise promised
that they should be further supplied with pitch,
tar, and all other necessaries, which was made
good to them; for people from the factory flocked
aboard every hour, and dealt with them as in open
market, for all sorts of merchandise, refreshments,
jewels, and plate, returning with coffers of money,
&amp;c. to a great value.</p>

<p class='c000'>The advice of the ship was taken very kindly, but
the pirates judging their own ship too large to go
close into the bay, consulted their friend upon
means for taking the said ship, who readily treated
with them for the sale of one of less burthen, that
then lay in the harbour; but Malpa speaking to one
Punt, of the factory, to carry her out, he not only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>refused to be concerned in such a piece of villany,
but reproved Malpa for corresponding with the
pirates, and told him, if he should be guilty of so
base an action, he must never see the face of any
of his countrymen more; which made the honest
broker change both his countenance and his purpose.</p>

<p class='c000'>At this place Capt. Woolley, whom they had taken
for their pilot on the Indian coast, being in a very
sick and weak condition, was, at his earnest entreaty,
discharged from his severe confinement
among them, and set ashore, and the next day the
pirates sailed, and ranged along the Malabar coast,
in quest of more booty. In their way they met a
second time with the Pembroke, and plundered
her of some sugar, and other small things, and
let her go again. From the coast they sailed
back for the Island of Mauritius, where they lay
some time, and lived after their usual extravagant
manner.</p>

<h3 id='KIDD' class='c007'>CAPTAIN ROBERT KIDD.</h3>

<p class='c008'>We are now going to give an account of one
whose name is well known in England. The person
we mean is Capt. Kidd, whose public trial and
execution here, rendered him the subject of all conversation,
so that his actions have been chanted
about in ballads. However, it is now a considerable
time since these things passed, and though the
people knew in general that Capt. Kidd was hanged,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>and that his crime was piracy, yet there were
scarce any, even at that time, who were acquainted
with his life or actions, or could account for his turning
pirate.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the beginning of king William’s war, Capt.
Kidd commanded a privateer in the West-Indies,
and by several adventurous actions acquired the
reputation of a brave man, as well as an experienced
seaman. About this time the pirates were very
troublesome in those parts: wherefore Capt. Kidd
was recommended by the Lord Bellamont, then
governor of Barbadoes, as well as by several other
persons, to the government here, as a person very
fit to be entrusted with the command of a government
ship, and to be employed in cruising upon the
pirates, as knowing those seas perfectly well, and
being acquainted with all their lurking places;
but what reasons governed the politics of those
times I cannot tell, but this proposal met with no
encouragement here, though it is certain it would
have been of great consequence to the subject, our
merchants suffering incredible damages by those
robbers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon this neglect, the lord Bellamont and some
others, who knew what great captures had been
made by the pirates, and what a prodigious wealth
must be in their possessions, were tempted to fit out
a ship at their own private charge, and to give the
command of her to Capt. Kidd; and to give the
thing a greater reputation, as well as to keep their
seamen under the better command, they procured
the king’s commission for the said Capt. Kidd, of
which the following is an exact copy:</p>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>William the Third</span>, by the grace of God,
King of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland,
defender of the faith, &amp;c. To our trusty and well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>beloved Capt. <span class='sc'>Robert Kidd</span>, commander of the ship
the Adventure galley, or to any other the commander
of the same for the time being, <em>Greeting</em>.
Whereas we are informed, that Capt. Thomas Too,
John Ireland, Capt Thomas Wake, and Capt. William
Maze, or Mace, and other subjects, natives or
inhabitants of New-York, and elsewhere, in our
plantations in America, have associated themselves
with divers others, wicked and ill-disposed persons,
and do against the law of nations commit many
and great piracies, robberies, and depredations on
the seas upon the parts of America, and in other
parts, to the great hindrance and discouragement of
trade and navigation, and to the great danger and
hurt of our loving subjects, our allies, and all others,
navigating the seas upon their lawful occasions.
<span class='sc'>Now know ye</span>, that we being desirous to prevent
the aforesaid mischiefs, and as much as in us lies,
to bring the said pirates, free-booters and sea-rovers
to justice, have thought fit, and do hereby give and
grant to the said Robert Kidd (to whom our commissioners
for exercising the office of Lord High
Admiral of England, have granted a commission as
a private man of war, bearing date the 11th day of
December, 1695,) and unto the commander of the
said ship for the time being, and unto the officers, mariners,
and others, which shall be under your command,
full power and authority to apprehend, seize,
and take into your custody as well the said Capt.
Thomas Too, John Ireland, Capt. Thomas Wake, and
Capt. William Maze, or Mace, as all such pirates, free-booters,
and sea-rovers, being either our subjects,
or of other nations associated with them, which you
shall meet with upon the seas or coasts of America,
or upon any other seas or coasts, with all their ships
and vessels, and all such merchandise, money,
goods, and wares as shall be found on board, or with
them, in case they shall willingly yield themselves;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>but if they will not yield without fighting, then you
are by force to compel them to yield. And we also
require you to bring, or cause to be brought, such
pirates, free-booters, or sea-rovers, as you shall
seize, to a legal trial, to the end they may be proceeded
against according to the law in such cases.
And we do hereby command all our officers, ministers,
and other our loving subjects whatsoever, to
be aiding and assisting to you in the premises.
And we do hereby enjoin you to keep an exact
journal of your proceedings in the execution of the
premises, and set down the names of such pirates,
and of their officers and company, and the names of
such ships and vessels as you shall by virtue of
these presents take and seize, and the quantities of
arms, ammunition, provision, and lading of such
ships, and the true value of the same, as near as you
judge. And we do hereby strictly charge and command
you, as you will answer the contrary at your
peril, that you do not, in any manner, offend or molest
our friends or allies, their ships or subjects, by
colour or pretence of these presents, or the authority
thereby granted. <em>In witness whereof</em>, we have
caused our great seal of England to be affixed to
these presents. Given at our court at Kensington,
the 26th day of January, 1695, in the 7th year of
our reign.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Capt. Kidd had also another commission, which
was called a commission of reprisals; for it being
then war time, this commission was to justify him
in the taking of French merchant ships, in case
he should meet with any; but as this commission
is nothing to our present purpose, we shall not
burthen the reader with it.</p>

<p class='c000'>With these two commissions he sailed out of
Plymouth in May, 1696, in the Adventure galley,
of 30 guns, and 80 men; the place he first designed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>for was New-York; in his voyage thither he took
a French banker, but this was no act of piracy, he
having a commission for that purpose, as we have
just observed.</p>

<p class='c000'>When he arrived at New-York, he put up articles
for engaging more hands, it being necessary to his
ship’s crew, since he proposed to deal with a desperate
enemy. The terms he offered were, that
every man should have a share of what was taken,
reserving for himself and owners forty shares.
Upon which encouragement he soon increased his
company to 155 men.</p>

<p class='c000'>With this company he sailed first for Madeira,
where he took in wine and some other necessaries;
from thence he proceeded to Bonavista, one of the
Cape-de-Verd Islands, to furnish the ship with salt,
and from thence went immediately to St. Jago,
another of the Cape-de-Verd Islands, in order to
stock himself with provisions. When all this was
done, he bent his course to Madagascar, the known
rendezvous of pirates. In his way he fell in with
Capt. Warren, commodore of three men of war:
he acquainted him with his design, kept them
company two or three days, and then leaving them,
made the best of his way for Madagascar, where he
arrived in February, 1696, just nine months from
his departure from Plymouth.</p>

<p class='c000'>It happened that at this time the pirate ships
were most of them out in search of prey; so that
according to the best intelligence Capt. Kidd could
get, there was not one of them at that time about
the island: wherefore, having spent some time in
watering his ship and taking in more provisions, he
thought of trying his fortune on the coast of Malabar,
where he arrived in the month of June following,
four months from his reaching Madagascar.
Hereabouts he made an unsuccessful cruise, touching
sometimes at the island of Mohila, and sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>at that of Johanna, between Malabar and
Madagascar. His provisions were every day wasting,
and his ship began to want repair: wherefore,
when he was at Johanna, he found means of borrowing
a sum of money from some Frenchmen who
had lost their ship, but saved their effects, and
with this he purchased materials for putting his
ship in good repair.</p>

<p class='c000'>It does not appear all this while that he had the
least design of turning pirate; for near Mohila and
Johanna both, he met with several Indian ships
richly laden, to which he did not offer the least
violence, though he was strong enough to have
done what he pleased with them; and first outrage
or depredation I find he committed upon mankind,
was after his repairing his ship, and leaving
Johanna; he touched at a place called Mabbee, upon
the Red Sea, where he took some Guinea corn
from the natives, by force. After this, he sailed to
Bab’s Key, a place upon a little island at the
entrance of the Red Sea. Here it was that he
first began to open himself to his ship’s company,
and let them understand that he intended to change
his measures; for, happening to talk of the Mocha
fleet, which was to sail that way, he said, <em>We have
been unsuccessful hitherto; but courage, my boys,
we’ll make our fortunes out of this fleet</em>; and finding
that none of them appeared averse to it, he ordered
a boat out, well manned, to go upon the coast to
make discoveries, commanding them to take a
prisoner and bring to him, or get intelligence any
way they could. The boat returned in a few days,
bringing him word, that they saw fourteen or fifteen
ships ready to sail, some with English, some
with Dutch, and some with Moorish colours.</p>

<p class='c000'>We cannot account for this sudden change in his
conduct, otherwise than by supposing that he first
meant well while he had hopes of making his fortune
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>by taking of pirates; but now weary of ill
success, and fearing lest his owners, out of humour
at their great expenses, should dismiss him, and he
should want employment, and be marked out for
an unlucky man; rather, I say, than run the hazard
of poverty, he resolved to do his business one
way, since he could not do it another.</p>

<p class='c000'>He therefore ordered a man continually to watch
at the mast head, lest this fleet should go by them;
and about four days after, towards evening, it
appeared in sight, being convoyed by one English
and one Dutch man of war. Kidd soon fell in with
them, and getting into the midst of them, fired at a
Moorish ship which was next him; but the men of
war taking the alarm, bore down upon Kidd, and
firing upon him, obliged him to sheer off, he not
being strong enough to contend with them. Now
he had begun hostilities, he resolved to go on, and
therefore he went and cruised along the coast
of Malabar. The first prize he met was a small
vessel belonging to Aden: the vessel was Moorish,
and the owners were Moorish merchants, but the
master was an Englishman; his name was Parker.
Kidd forced him and a Portuguese that was called
Don Antonio, which were all the Europeans on
board, to take on with him; the first he designed
as a pilot, and the last as an interpreter. He also
used the men very cruelly, causing them to be
hoisted up by the arms, and drubbed with a naked
cutlass, to force them to discover whether they had
money on board, and where it lay; but as they had
neither gold nor silver on board, he got nothing by
his cruelty; however, he took from them a bale of
pepper, and a bale of coffee, and so let them go.</p>

<p>Kidd’s Engagement with the Fleet. &#8196; &#8196; &#8196; Page <a href='#Page_62'>62</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>A little time after he touched a Carawar, a place
upon the same coast, where, before he arrived, the
news of what he had done to the Moorish ship had
reached them; for some of the English merchants
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>there had received an account of it from the owners
who corresponded with them; wherefore, as
soon as Kidd came in, he was suspected to be the
person who committed this piracy; and one Mr.
Harvey and Mr. Mason, two of the English factory,
came on board and asked for Parker, and Antonio,
the Portuguese; but Kidd denied that he knew any
such persons, having secured them both in a private
place in the hold, where they were kept for seven
or eight days, that is, till Kidd sailed from thence.</p>

<p class='c000'>However, the coast was alarmed, and a Portuguese
man of war was sent out to cruise. Kidd
met with her, and fought her about six hours, gallantly
enough; but finding her too strong to be
taken he quitted her; for he was able to run away
from her when he would. Then he went to a place
called Porca, where he watered the ship, and bought
a number of hogs of the natives to victual his company.</p>

<p class='c000'>Soon after this, he came up with a Moorish ship,
the master whereof was a Dutchman, called Schipper
Mitchell, and chased her under French colours,
which they observing, hoisted French colours too;
when he came up with her, he hailed her in French,
and they having a Frenchman on board, answered
him in the same language; upon which he ordered
them to send their boat on board; they were obliged
to do so, and having examined who they were,
and from whence they came, he asked the Frenchman,
who was a passenger, if he had a French pass
for himself; the Frenchman gave him to understand
that he had. Then he told the Frenchman
he must pass for captain, and by ——, says he, you
are the captain: the Frenchman durst not refuse
doing as he would have him. The meaning of this
was, that he would seize the ship as fair prize, and as
if she had belonged to French subjects, according to
a commission he had for that purpose; though, one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>would think, after what he had already done, that
he need not have recourse to a quibble to give his
actions a colour.</p>

<p class='c000'>In short, he took the cargo, and sold it some
time after; yet still he seemed to have some fears
upon him, lest these proceedings should have a
bad end; for, coming up with a Dutch ship some
time after, when his men thought of nothing but attacking
her, Kidd opposed it; upon which a mutiny
arose, and the majority being for taking the said
ship, and arming themselves to man the boat to go
and seize her, he told them, such as did, never
should come on board him again; which put an
end to the design, so that he kept company with
the said ship some time, without offering her any
violence. However, this dispute was the occasion
of an accident, upon which an indictment was after
wards grounded against Kidd; for Moor, the gunner,
being one day upon deck, and talking with
Kidd, about the said Dutch ship, some words arose
between them, and Moor told Kidd, that he had
ruined them all; upon which, Kidd, calling him a
dog, took up a bucket and struck him with it, which
breaking his scull, he died the next day.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Kidd’s penitential fit did not last long, for
coasting along Malabar, he met with a great number
of boats, all which he plundered. Upon the
same coast he also fell in with a Portuguese ship,
which he kept possession of a week, and then having
taken out of her some chests of India goods,
thirty jars of butter, with some wax, iron, and a
hundred bags of rice, he let her go.</p>

<p class='c000'>Much about the same time he went to one of the
Malabar islands for wood and water, and his cooper
being ashore, was murdered by the natives; upon
which Kidd himself landed, and burnt and pillaged
several of their houses, the people running away;
but having taken one, he caused him to be tied to a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>tree, and commanded one of his men to shoot him;
then putting to sea again he took the greatest prize
which fell into his hands while he followed this
trade: this was a Moorish ship of 400 tons, richly
laden, named the Queda Merchant, the master
whereof was an Englishman, by the name of
Wright; for the Indians often make use of English
or Dutchmen to command their ships, their own
mariners not being so good artists in navigation.
Kidd chased her under French colours, and having
come up with her, he ordered her to hoist out her
boat, and to send on board of him, which being
done, he told Wright he was his prisoner; and informing
himself concerning the said ship, he understood
there were no Europeans on board, except
two Dutch, and one Frenchman, all the rest
being Indians or Armenians, and that the Armenians
were part owners of the cargo. Kidd gave the Armenians
to understand, that if they would offer any
thing that was worth his taking for their ransom,
he would hearken to it. Upon which, they proposed
to pay him 20,000 rupees, not quite £3000 sterling;
but Kidd judged this would be making a bad
bargain, wherefore he rejected it, and setting the
crew on shore, at different places on the coast, he
soon sold as much of the cargo as came to ten
thousand pounds. With part of it he also trafficked,
receiving in exchange provisions, or such other
goods as he wanted; by degrees he disposed of the
whole cargo, and when the division was made, it
came to about £200 a man; and having reserved
forty shares to himself, his dividend amounted to
about £8000 sterling.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Indians along the coast came on board and
trafficked with all freedom, and he punctually performed
his bargains, till about the time he was
ready to sail; and then thinking he should have no
further occasion for them, he made no scruple of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>taking their goods, and setting them on shore without
any payment in money or goods, which they
little expected; for as they had been used to deal
with pirates, they always found them men of honour
in the way of trade; a people, enemies to deceit,
and that scorned to rob but in their own way.</p>

<p class='c000'>Kidd put some of his men on board the Queda
Merchant, and with this ship and his own, sailed
for Madagascar. As soon as he had arrived and
cast anchor, there came on board of him a canoe, in
which were several Englishmen, who had formerly
been well acquainted with Kidd. As soon as they
saw him they saluted him, and told him, they were
informed he was come to take them, and hang them,
which would be a little unkind in such an old acquaintance.
Kidd soon dissipated their doubts, by
swearing he had no such design, and that he was
now in every respect their brother, and just as bad
as they; and calling for a cup of bombo, drank
their captain’s health.</p>

<p class='c000'>These men belonged to a pirate ship, called the
Resolution, formerly the Mocha Merchant, whereof
one Capt. Culliford was commander, and which lay
at anchor not far from them. Kidd went on board
with them, promising them his friendship and assistance,
and Culliford in his turn came on board of
Kidd; and Kidd to testify his sincerity in iniquity,
finding Culliford in want of some necessaries, made
him a present of an anchor and some guns, to fit
him out for sea again.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Adventure galley was now so old and leaky,
that they were forced to keep two pumps continually
going; wherefore Kidd shifted all the guns and
tackle out of her into the Queda Merchant, intending
her for his man of war; and as he had divided
the money before, he now made a division of the
remainder of the cargo: soon after which, the
greatest part of the company left him, some going
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>on board Capt. Culliford, and others absconding
into the country, so that he had not above 40 men
left.</p>

<p class='c000'>He put to sea, and happened to touch at Amboyna,
one of the Dutch spice islands, where he was
told, that the news of his actions had reached England,
and that he was there declared a pirate.</p>

<p class='c000'>The truth of it is, his piracies so alarmed our
merchants, that some motions were made in parliament,
to inquire into the commission that was given
him, and the persons who fitted him out. These
proceedings seemed to lean a little hard upon Lord
Bellamont, who thought himself so much touched
thereby, that he published a justification of himself
in a pamphlet, after Kidd’s execution. In a mean
time it was thought advisable, in order to stop the
course of these piracies, to publish a proclamation,
offering the king’s free pardon to all such pirates as
should voluntarily surrender themselves, whatever
piracies they had been guilty of, at any time before
the last day of April, 1699—that is to say, for all
piracies committed eastward of the Cape of Good
Hope, to the longitude and meridian of Socatora,
and Cape Cormorin; in which proclamation, Avery
and Kidd were excepted by name.</p>

<p class='c000'>When Kidd left Amboyna he knew nothing of
this proclamation, for certainly had he had notice of
his being excepted in it, he would not have been so
infatuated, as to run himself into the very jaws of
danger; but relying upon his interest with the lord
Bellamont, and fancying that a French pass or two
he found on board some of the ships he took, would
serve to countenance the matter, and that part of
the booty he got would gain him new friends—I
say all these things made him flatter himself that all
would be hushed, and that justice would but wink at
him.—Wherefore he sailed directly for New-York,
where he was no sooner arrived, but by the Lord
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>Bellamont’s orders, he was secured with all his papers
and effects. Many of his fellow-adventurers,
who had forsook him at Madagascar, came over
from thence passengers, some to New-England and
some to Jersey; where hearing of the king’s proclamation
for pardoning of pirates, they surrendered
themselves to the governor of those places. At
first they were admitted to bail, but soon after laid
in strict confinement, where they were kept for
some time, till an opportunity happened of sending
them with their captain over to England to be tried.</p>

<p class='c000'>Accordingly a sessions of admiralty being held
at the Old Bailey, in May, 1701, Capt. Kidd, Nicholas
Churchill, James How, Robert Lumley, William
Jenkins, Gabriel Loff, Hugh Parrot, Richard
Barlicorn, Abel Owens, and Darby Mullins, were
arraigned for piracy and robbery on the high seas,
and all found guilty except three: these were Robert
Lumley, William Jenkins, and Richard Barlicorn,
who proving themselves to be apprentices to
some of the officers of the ship, and producing their
indentures in court, were<a id='t68'></a> acquitted.</p>

<p class='c000'>The three above mentioned, though they were
proved to be concerned in taking and sharing the
ship and goods mentioned in the indictment, yet, as
the gentlemen of the long robe rightly distinguished,
there was a great difference between their circumstances
and the rest; for there must go an intention
of the mind and a freedom of the will to the
committing an act of felony or piracy. A pirate is
not to be understood to be under constraint, but
a free agent; for in this case, the bare act will not
make a man guilty, unless the will make it so.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now a servant, it is true, if he go voluntarily, and
have his proportion, he must be accounted a pirate,
for then he acts upon his own account, and not by
compulsion; and these persons, according to the
evidence, received their part, but whether they accounted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>to their masters for their shares afterwards,
is the matter in question, and what distinguishes
them as free agents, or men that did go under the
compulsion of their masters, which being left to the
consideration of the jury, they found them <em>not
guilty</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Kidd was tried upon an indictment of murder also,
viz. for killing Moor, the gunner, and found guilty
of the same. Nicholas Churchill, and James How
pleaded the king’s pardon, as having surrendered
themselves within the time limited in the proclamation,
and Col. Bass, governor of West-Jersey, to
whom they surrendered, being in court, and called
upon, proved the same. However, this plea was
over-ruled by the court, because there being four
commissioners named in the proclamation, viz.
Capt. Thomas Warren, Israel Hayes, Peter Delannoye,
and Christopher Pollard, Esqrs. who were
appointed commissioners, and sent over on purpose
to receive the submission of such pirates as should
surrender, it was adjudged no other person was
qualified to receive their surrender, and that they
could not be entitled to the benefit of the said proclamation,
because they had not in all circumstances
complied with the conditions of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Darby Mullins urged in his defence, that he served
under the king’s commission, and therefore could
not disobey his commander without incurring great
punishments; that whenever a ship or ships went
out upon any expedition under the king’s commission,
the men were never allowed to call their officers
to an account, why they did this, or why they
did that, because such a liberty would destroy all
discipline: that if any thing was done which was
unlawful, the officers were to answer it, for the men
did no more than their duty in obeying orders. He
was told by the court, that acting under the commission
justified in what was lawful, but not in what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>was unlawful. He answered he stood in need of
nothing to justify him in what was lawful, but the
case of seamen must be very hard, if they must be
brought into such danger for obeying the commands
of their officers, and punished for not obeying
them, and if they were allowed to dispute the
orders, there could be no such thing as command
kept up at sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>This seemed to be the best defence the thing
could bear; but his taking a share of the plunder,
the seamen’s mutinying on board several times,
and taking upon them to control the captain, showed
there was no obedience paid to the commission;
and that they acted in all things according to the
custom of pirates and free-booters, which weighing
with the jury, they brought him in guilty with
the rest.</p>

<p class='c000'>As to Capt. Kidd’s defence, he insisted much on
his own innocence, and the villany of his men. He
said, he went out in a laudable employment and had
no occasion, being then in good circumstances, to
go a pirating; that the men often mutinied against
him, and did as they pleased; that he was threatened
to be shot in the cabin, and that ninety-five
left him at one time, and set fire to his boat, so that
he was disabled from bringing his ship home, or the
prizes he took, to have them regularly condemned,
which he said were taken by virtue of a commission
under the broad seal, they having French
passes. The captain called one Col. Hewson to his
reputation, who gave him an extraordinary character,
and declared to the court, that he had served
under his command, and been in two engagements
with him against the French, in which he fought as
well as any man he ever saw; that there were only
Kidd’s ship and his own against Monsieur du Cass,
who commanded a squadron of six sail, and they
got the better of him. But this being several years
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>before the facts mentioned in the indictment were
committed, proved of no manner of service to the
prisoner on his trial.</p>

<p class='c000'>As to the friendship shown to Culliford, a notorious
pirate, Kidd denied, and said, he intended
to have taken him, but his men being a parcel of
rogues and villains refused to stand by him, and
several of them ran away from his ship to the said
pirate.—But the evidence being full and particular
against him, he was found guilty as before mentioned.</p>

<p class='c000'>When Kidd was asked what he had to say why
sentence should not pass against him, he answered,
that <em>he had nothing to say, but that he had been
sworn against by perjured and wicked people</em>. And
when sentence was pronounced, he said, <em>my Lord,
it is a very hard sentence. For my part, I am the
most innocent person of them all, only I have been
sworn against by perjured persons.</em></p>

<p class='c000'>Wherefore about a week after, Capt. Kidd,
Nicholas Churchill, James How, Gabriel Loff, Hugh
Parrot, Abel Owen, and Darby Mullins, were executed
at Execution Dock, and afterwards hung up
in chains, at some distance from each other, down
the river, where their bodies hung exposed for
many years.</p>

<p class='c008'>Before I enter on the adventures of this pirate
I must take notice to the reader of the reasons
which made me not continue the life of Misson.</p>

<p class='c000'>In reading the notes, which I have by me, relating
to Capt. Tew, I found him joined with Misson;
and that I must be either guilty of repetition, or give
an account of Tew in Misson’s life, which is contrary
to the method I proposed, that of giving a distinct
relation of every pirate who has made any figure:
and surely Tew, in point of gallantry, was inferior
to none, and may justly claim a particular account
of his actions. However, before I enter on the life
of this pirate, I shall continue that of Misson to the
time that these two commanders met.</p>

<p class='c000'>The blacks seeing them so much on their guard,
brought out boiled rice and fowls, and after they had
satisfied their hunger, the chief made signs that
they were the same who had carried a negro to their
ships, and sent for the axe and piece of baize they
had given him. While this passed, the very negro
came from hunting, who seemed overjoyed to see
them. The chief made signs that they might return,
and ten negroes coming to them, laden with fowls
and kids, he gave them to understand, they should
accompany them to their ships with these presents.
They parted very amicably, and in hopes of settling
a good correspondence with these natives. All the
houses were neatly framed and jointed, not built
from any foundation, but so made, that half a dozen
men could lift and transport them from place to
place. The hunters, returning to their ships, with
these presents and negroes, were joyfully received;
and the negroes were not only caressed, but laden
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>with baize, iron kettles, and rum, besides the present
of a cutlass for the chief.</p>

<p class='c000'>While the negroes stayed, which was the space
of three days, they examined and admired the forts
and growing town, in which all hands were busied,
and not even the prisoners excused.</p>

<p class='c000'>As Misson apprehended no danger from the land,
his fort, though of wood, being, he thought, a sufficient
defence to his infant colony, he took 160
hands, and went a second time on the coast of Zanguebar,
and off Quiloa he gave chase to a large ship
which lay by for him. She proved an over-match
for the Victoire, which engaged her, with great loss
of men, near eight glasses; but finding he was more
likely to be taken, than to make a prize, by the advice
of his officers and men, endeavoured to leave the
Portuguese, which was a 50 gun ship, and had 300
men on board; but he found this attempt vain, for
the Portuguese sailed as well as the Victoire, and
her commander, who was a resolute and brave man,
seeing him endeavour to shake him off, clapped him
on board, but lost most of the men he entered.
Misson’s crew, not used to be attacked, and expecting
no quarter, fought so desperately, that they not
only thoroughly cleared their decks, but some of
them followed the Portuguese, who leaped into
their own ship; which Misson seeing, hoped to
make an advantage of their despair, and crying out,
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Elle est a nous, a l’abordage</span></i>—<em>She’s our own, board,
board her</em>—so many of his men followed the few,
that hardly were there enough left to work the
ship. Misson, observing the resolution of his men,
grappled the Portuguese ship, and leaped on board
himself, crying out, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la mort, ou la victoire</span></i>—<em>death or
victory</em>. The Portuguese, who thought themselves
in a manner conquerors, seeing the enemy not only
drive off those who entered them, but board with
such resolution, began to quit the decks in spite of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>their officers. The captain and Misson met, as he
was endeavouring to hinder the flight of his men.
They engaged with equal bravery with their cutlasses:
but Misson striking him on the neck, he fell
down the main hatch, which put an end to the fight,
for the Portuguese seeing their captain fall, threw
down their arms, and called for quarters, which was
granted; and all the prisoners without distinction
being ordered between decks, and the powder rooms
secured, he put 35 men on board the prize, and
made the best of his way to Libertatia. This was
the dearest prize he ever made, for he lost 56 men.
She was vastly rich in gold, having near £200,000
sterling on board, being her own and the cargo of
her companion, which was lost upon the coast, of
whose crew she had saved one hundred men out
of 120, the rest being lost by endeavouring to swim
ashore. This was the reason that the prize was so
well manned, and proved so considerable.</p>

<p class='c000'>Being within sight of Madagascar, they spied a
sloop which stood for them, and when in gun shot,
threw out black colours, and fired a gun to windward.
Misson brought too, fired another to leeward,
and hoisted out his boat, which the sloop
perceiving, lay by for. Misson’s lieutenant went
on board, and was received very civilly by Capt. Tew,
who was the commander, to whom the lieutenant
gave a short account of their adventures and new
settlement, inviting him very kindly on board Capt.
Misson. Tew told him, he could not consent to go
with him till he had the opinion of his men. In the
mean while, Misson coming along side, hailed the
sloop, and invited the captain on board, desiring his
lieutenant would stay as a hostage, if they were in
the least jealous of him, which they had no reason
to be, since he was of force so much superior, that
he need not employ stratagem. This determined
the company on board the sloop, who advised their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>captain to go with the lieutenant, whom they
would not suffer to stay behind, to show the greater
confidence in their new friends.</p>

<p class='c000'>My reader may be surprised that a single sloop
should venture to give chase to two ships of such
countenance as were the Victoire and her prize;
but this wonder will cease, when he is acquainted
with the sequel.</p>

<p class='c000'>Capt. Tew, after being handsomely regaled on
board the Victoire, and thoroughly satisfied, returned
on board his sloop, gave an account of what
he had learned, and his men consenting, he gave
orders to steer the same course with Misson, whose
settlement it was agreed to visit. I shall here leave
them to give an account of Capt. Tew.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Richier, governor of Bermuda, fitted out
two sloops on the privateer account, commanded by
Capt. George Drew, and Capt. Thomas Tew, with
instructions to make the best of their way to the
river Gambia, in Africa, and there, with the advice
and assistance of the agent for the royal African
company, to attempt the taking the French factory
of Goree on that coast.</p>

<p class='c000'>The above commanders having their commissions
and instructions from the governor, took their
departure from Bermuda, and kept company some
time; but Drew springing his mast, and a violent
storm coming upon them, they lost each other.</p>

<p class='c000'>Tew being separated from his consort, thought
of providing for his future ease, by making one bold
push; and accordingly, calling all hands on deck, he
spoke to them to this purpose.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That they were not ignorant of the design
with which the governor fitted them out: the
making and destroying the French factory; that he,
indeed, readily agreed to take a commission to
this end, though contrary to his judgment, because
it was for the sake of being employed; but that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>thought it a very injudicious expedition, which, did
they succeed in, would be of no use to the public,
and only be of advantage to a private company of
men, from whom they could expect no reward for
their bravery; that he could see nothing but danger
in the undertaking, without the least prospect of
booty; that he could not suppose any man fond of
fighting for fighting’s sake; and few ventured their
lives, but with some view either of particular interest
or public good: but here was not the least
appearance of either. Wherefore, he was of opinion,
that they should turn their thoughts on what
might better their circumstances; and if they were
so inclined, he would undertake to shape a course
which should lead them to ease and plenty, in
which they might pass the rest of their days. That
one bold push would do their business, and they
might return home, not only without danger, but
even with reputation.” The crew finding he expected
their resolution, cried one, and all, “<em>A
gold chain or a wooden leg—we’ll stand by you</em>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Hearing this, he desired they would choose a
quarter-master, who might consult with him for the
common good; which was accordingly done.</p>

<p class='c000'>I must acquaint the reader, that on board the
West-India privateers and free-booters, the quarter-master’s
opinion is like the Mufti’s among the
Turks: the captain can undertake nothing which
the quarter-master does not approve. We may
say the quarter-master is a humble imitation of the
Roman tribune of the people; he speaks for, and
looks after the interest of the crew.</p>

<p class='c000'>Tew, now, instead of proceeding on his voyage
to Gambia, shaped his course for the Cape of Good
Hope, which doubling, he steered for the straits of
Babelmandel, entering into the Red Sea, where
they came up with a lofty ship bound from the
Indies to Arabia; she was richly laden, and as she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>was to clear the coasts of rovers, five more, extremely
rich (one especially in gold) being to follow
her, she had 300 soldiers on board, besides her seamen.</p>

<p class='c000'>Tew, on making this ship, told his men she carried
their fortunes, which they would find no difficulty
to take possession of; for though he was satisfied
she was full of men, and was mounted with a
great number of guns, they wanted the two things
necessary, skill and courage: and, indeed, so it
proved, for he boarded and carried her without loss,
every one taking more care to run from danger,
than to exert himself in the defence of his goods.</p>

<p class='c000'>In rummaging this prize, the pirates threw over
a great many rich bales, to search for gold, silver
and jewels; and having taken what they thought
proper, together with the powder, part of which
(as being more than they could handsomely stow)
they threw into the sea, they left her, sharing
£3000 sterling a man.</p>

<p class='c000'>Encouraged by this success, Capt. Tew proposed
going in quest of the other five ships, of which he
had intelligence from the prize; but the quarter-master
opposing him. He was obliged to drop the
design, and steer for Madagascar.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here the quarter-master finding this island productive
of all the necessaries of life; and the air
was wholesome, soil fruitful, and the sea abounding
with fish, proposed settling; but only three and
twenty of the crew came into the proposal: the
rest stayed with Captain Tew, who having given
the new settlers their share of plunder, designed to
return to America, as they afterwards did; but spying,
the Victoire and her prize, he thought he might,
by their means, return somewhat richer, and resolved
to speak with them, as I have already said.</p>

<p class='c000'>Tew and his company having taken the above
resolution of visiting Monsieur Misson’s colony,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>arrived with him, and was not a little surprised
to see his fortifications.</p>

<p class='c000'>When they came under the first fort, they saluted
it with nine guns, and were answered by an
equal number. All the prisoners, at their coming
to an anchor, were suffered to come up, a privilege
they had never before granted them, on account of
the few hands left them, except two or three at a
time.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The joy those ashore expressed at the sight of so
considerable a prize as they judged her at first
sight, was vastly allayed, when they heard how dear
a purchase she had proved to them. However, the
reinforcement of the sloop made some amends.
Capt. Tew was received by Caraccioli and the rest,
with great civility and respect, who did not a little
admire his courage, both in attacking the prize he
made, and afterwards in giving chase to Misson.
He was called to the council of officers, which was
immediately held, to consider what methods should
be taken with the prisoners, who were, by 190
brought in by this new prize, near as numerous as
those of his own party, though Tew joined them
with 70 men. It was therefore resolved to keep
them separate from the Portuguese and English,
who were before taken, to make them believe they
were in amity with a prince of the natives, who was
very powerful, and to propose to them, at their
choice, the assisting the new colony in their works,
or being sent prisoners up the country, if they rejected
entering in with them. Seventy-three took
on, and the rest desired they might be any way employed
rather than be sent up the country; 117 then
were set to work upon a dock, which was laid out
about half a mile above the mouth of the harbour,
and the other prisoners were forbid to pass such
bounds as were prescribed then on pain of death;
lest they, knowing their own strength, should revolt;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>for I must acquaint the reader, that on the arrival
of the Victoire, both their loss and the number
of Portuguese they brought in, was known to
none but themselves, and the number of those
who came over, magnified; besides, the Johanna
men were all armed and disciplined, and the Bijoux
lay as a guard-ship, where the last prisoners were
set to work; but while they provided for their security,
both within and without, they did not neglect
providing also for their support, for they dug
and sowed a large plat of ground with Indian and
European corn, and other seeds which they found
on board their prizes. In the mean while, Caraccioli,
who had the art of persuasion, wrought on many
of the Portuguese, who saw no hopes of returning
home to join them. Misson, who could not be
easy in an inactive life, would have taken another
cruise; but fearing the revolt of the prisoners, durst
not weaken the colony by the hands he must necessarily
take with him. Wherefore, he proposed giving
the last prize to, and sending away the prisoners.
Caraccioli and Capt. Tew were against it, saying,
that it would discover their retreat, and cause
their being attacked by the Europeans, who had
settlements along the continent, before they were
able to defend themselves. Misson replied, he
could not bear to be always diffident of those about
him; that it was better to die at once, than live in
continual apprehensions of death: that the time
was come for sending away the Johanna men, and
that they could not go without a ship; neither durst
he trust a ship out, not well manned, nor man her
while so many prisoners were with him. Wherefore
there was a necessity of sending them off, or of
putting them all to the sword; a barbarity by which
he would not purchase his security. A council was
called, and what Capt. Misson had proposed, agreed
to. The prisoners were then summoned, and he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>told them, in few words, that he knew the consequence
of giving them liberty; that he expected to
be attacked as soon as the place of his retreat was
known, and had it in his hands by putting them to
death, to avoid the doubtful fate of war; but his humanity
would not suffer him to entertain a thought
so cruel, and his alliances with the natives, he hoped,
would enable him to repel his assailants; but
he required an oath of every one, that he should
not serve against him. He then inquired into the
circumstances of every particular man, and what
they had lost, all which he returned, telling the
company it should be reckoned as part of his share;
and the prisoners, that he did not make war with
the oppressed, but the oppressors. The prisoners
were charmed with this mark of generosity, and
wished he might never meet a treatment unworthy
of that he gave them. The ship victualled for a
voyage to the coast of Zanguebar, all her guns and
ammunition taken out with the spare sails, and
spare rigging, all were ordered to be gone; and 137
departed, highly applauding the behaviour of their
enemies. All this while they had heard nothing
from the natives, nor had the hunting parties met
with any of them, which made Misson suspect they
were afraid of his being their neighbour, and had
shifted their quarters; but as the Johanna men
were upon going away, there came about 50 negroes
to them, driving about 100 head of black cattle,
20 negro men bound, and 25 women, for which
cattle and prisoners they bartered rum, hatchets,
baize, and beads; some hogsheads of which last
commodity they had taken on the coast of Angola.
Here the negroes belonging to Misson were provided
with wives: the natives were caressed, and
to the slaves signs made that their liberty was given
them; they were immediately clothed and put
under the care of as many whites, who, by all possible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>demonstrations, endeavoured to make them understand
that they were enemies to slavery. The
natives stayed ten days, which retarded the departure
of the Johanna men; but, upon their retiring,
the Bijoux sailed with 100 of them on board, under
the command of Caraccioli’s lieutenant, who excused
the keeping them longer than was promised,
and not bringing them at once, having no more than
two ships. The Portuguese ship, which was unrigged,
being made a hulk, the ten men of Misson’s
company who had settled at Johanna, being desirous
to return, were brought to Libertatia with their
wives (of which they had two or three a piece) and
their children. The Bijoux, at two more voyages,
carried over the rest of the Johannians.</p>

<p class='c000'>Misson hove down the Bijoux, and resolving on
a cruise on the coast of Guinea, to strengthen his
colony by the capture of some slaving ship, he gave
the command of her to Capt. Tew, and he and Caraccioli
pressed the work of the dock. He gave
him also 200 hands, of which 40 were Portuguese,
37 negroes, 17 of them expert sailors, 30 English,
and the rest French. Tew met with nothing in his
way, till he came to the northward of the Cape of
Good Hope, when he fell in with a Dutch East-India
galley of 18 guns, which he took after a small
resistance, and with the loss of one man only. On
the coast of Angola he took an English Guinea-man
with 240 slaves, men, women, and boys. The
negroes who had been before taken on this coast,
found among these a great many of their acquaintance,
and several of their relations, to whom they
reported their unexpected change of fortune, the
great captain (for so they now called Misson) having
humanely knocked off their chains, and of slaves
made them free men, and sharers in his fortunes:
that the same good fortune had attended them in
their falling into his hands, for he abhorred even the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>name of slavery. Tew, following the orders and
acquainted with the policy of Misson, ordered the
fetters and handcuffs to be taken off, upon his negro
sailors assuring him they would not revolt, and
were sensible of their happiness in falling into his
hands. Content with these prizes, he made the best
of his way home to Libertatia where he arrived
without any sinister accident; but I forgot to tell my
reader, that he set his Dutch prisoners (nine excepted,
who took on with him) ashore, about 30 miles to
the northward of the Cape of Saldanha Bay, where
had been buried, by Capt. Misson, the English commander.
He found a great quantity of English
crowns on board his Dutch prize, which were carried
into the common treasury; money being of no
use where every thing was in common, and no
hedge bounded any particular man’s property.
The slaves he had released in this last cruise were
employed in perfecting the dock, and treated on
the footing of free people. They were not ignorant
of the change of their condition, and were therefore
extremely diligent and faithful. A white man, or
one of the old standing negroes, wrought with
every four, and made them understand the French
words (by often repetition, and the help of their
countrymen’s interpreting) used in their works
Misson ordered a couple of sloops to be built in a
creek, of eighty tons each, which he mounted with
eight guns a piece, out of a Dutch prize. These
were perfected in a little time, and proved not only
shapely vessels, but excellent sailers. The officers
of these sloops were chosen by balloting, and as
their first design was only to discover and lay down
a chart of the coast, sands, shoals, and depth of water
round the island of Madagascar, the schoolmaster
being sent with the command of one, Tew
desired and had the other. They were manned,
each sloop with 50 white and 50 black men: which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>voyage round the island was of vast advantage in
giving the new released Angola negroes a notion of
working a vessel;—and they were very industrious
both in endeavouring to learn the French language,
and to be useful. These sloops, the one of
which was called the Childhood, and the other the
Liberty, were near four months on this expedition.
In the mean while, a few of the natives had come
often to the settlement, and began to speak a little
French, mixed with the other European languages,
which they heard among Misson’s people, and six
of the native families fixed among them, which was
of vast use to the planters of this colony; for they
made a very advantageous report to their countrymen
of the regularity and harmony they observed
in them. The sloops having returned, and an exact
chart taken of the coast, Caraccioli had a mind for
a cruise. He proposed visiting all the neighbouring
islands, and accordingly went out to Mascarenhas,
and the other islands near it, taking one half
of his crew of negroes, and returned with a Dutch
prize, which he took off the above mentioned island
where<a id='t83'></a> they were about fixing a colony. This prize,
as it had on board all sorts of European goods, and
necessaries for settling, was more valuable than if
it had been vastly richer. The negroes growing
useful hands, Misson resolved on a cruise to the
northward, encouraged by Tew’s success; and
with all the blacks, which he divided between the
two ships, one of which Capt. Tew commanded set
out with 500 men. Off the coast of Arabia Felix
they fell in with a ship belonging to the Great Mogul,
bound for Zidon, with pilgrims to Mecca, who, with
Moor mariners, made up the number of 1600 souls.
This ship carried 110 guns, but made a very poor
defence, being encumbered with the goods and number
of passengers they carried. The two adventurers
did not think it their business to cannonade,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>they therefore boarded as soon as they came up
with her, and the Moors no sooner saw them entered,
but they discharged one volley of small arms
at random, we may suppose, because no execution
was done, and fled the decks. Being masters of
this ship, which did not cost them a single man, they
consulted what they should do with her, and the
prisoners, and it was resolved to set them ashore
between Ain and Aden.</p>

<p class='c000'>They now made the best of their way for Madagascar,
putting 200 hands on board the prize, which
proved a very heavy sailer, and retarded them very
much. Off the Cape Guarde Fin they were overtaken
with a cruel storm, which was near wrecking
them on the island called Irmanos; but the wind
coming about due north, they had the good luck to
escape this danger. Though the fury of the wind
abated, yet it blew so hard for twelve days together,
that they could only carry their coursers reefed.
They spied a sail in their passage, but the weather
would not permit their endeavouring to speak with
her. In a word, they returned to Libertatia with
their prize, without any other accident; but the
captors could make no estimate of her value, she
having on board a vast quantity of diamonds, besides
rich silks, raw silks, spices, carpets, wrought
and bar gold. The prize was taken to pieces, as
she was of no use; her cordage and knee timber preserved,
with all the bolts, eyes, chains, and other
iron work, and her guns planted on two points of
the harbour, where they raised batteries, so that
they were now so strongly fortified they apprehended
no danger from any number of shipping which
could be brought into those seas to attack them.
They had, by this time, cleared, sown, and enclosed
a good parcel of ground, and taken in a quantity of
pasturage, where they had above 300 head of black
cattle, bought of the natives. The dock was now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>finished, and the Victoire growing old and unfit for
a long voyage, and the last storm having shook,
and loosened her very much, she was pulled to
pieces and rebuilt, keeping the same name. She
was rigged, victualled, and fit to go to sea, and was
to sail to the coast of Guinea for more negroes,
when one of the sloops came in, which had been
sent out rather to exercise the negroes, than with
any view of making a prize, and brought word that
five lofty ships chased her into the bay, and stood
for their harbour; that she judged them to be Portuguese
by their built, and 50 gun ships, full of men.
This proved the real truth. The alarm was given,
the forts and batteries manned, and every man stood
to his arms. Misson took upon him the command
of 100 negroes, who were well disciplined, (for every
morning they had been used to perform their exercise,
which was taught them by a French serjeant,
one of their company, who belonged to the Victoire)
to be ready where his assistance should be required,
Tew commanded all the English. They had hardly
ordered their affairs when these ships hove in sight,
and stood directly for the harbour with Portuguese
colours. They were warmly received by the two
forts, which did not stop them, though it brought
one of them on the careen. They entered the harbour,
and thought they had done their business, but
were saluted so warmly from the forts, batteries,
sloops, and ships, that two of them sunk downright,
and a great many men were drowned, though some
got on board the other ships. The Portuguese, who
did not imagine they had been so well fortified, and
thought in passing the two forts they should without
difficulty land their men, and easily root out this
nest of pirates, found now their mistake, for they
durst not venture to hoist out a boat. They had
wisely, however, contrived to enter just before the
turn of the tide. Finding the attempt vain, and that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>they had lost a great many men, they clapped upon
a wind, and with the help of the tide of ebb, made
more haste out than they did to get in, leaving two
of their ships sunk in the harbour; but they did not
get off so cheaply, for no sooner were they clear of
the forts, but Misson, manning with the utmost expedition
both the ships and sloops, gave them chase,
and engaged them at the mouth of the bay. The
Portuguese defended themselves with a great deal
of gallantry, and one of them beat off the Libertatians
twice, who boarded them from the two sloops;
two of them, finding themselves hard pressed made
a running fight, and got off, and left the third to
shift as well as she could. The Bijoux and Victoire
finding the Portuguese endeavoured to clear themselves
and knowing there was little to be got by
the captures, gave over the chase, and fell upon
the third, who defended himself till his decks swam
with blood, and the greater number of his men
killed; but finding all resistance vain, and that he
was left to an unequal fight by his companions, he
called for quarter, and good quarter was given,
both to himself and men. This prize yielded them
a great quantity of powder and shot, and, indeed,
they expected nothing of value out of her. None of
the prisoners were stripped, and the officers, Misson,
Caraccioli, and Tew invited to their tables,
treating them very civilly, and extolling the courage
they had shown in their defence. Unhappily two
prisoners were found on board, who had been released,
and had sworn never to serve against them;
these were clapped in irons, and publicly tried for
their perjury. The Portuguese officers being present,
the witnesses proved them the very discharged
men, and they were condemned to be hanged at
the point of each fort; which execution was performed
the next morning after their condemnation,
with the assistance of the Portuguese chaplain,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>who attended, confessed, and absolved them. This
was the engagement with the pirates, which made
so much noise in the Lisbon Gazette, and these the
men whom the English ignorantly took for Avery;
who, we had a notion here in London, had 32 sail
of men of war, and had taken upon himself the
state and title of king.</p>

<p class='c000'>This execution seeming to impugn the maxims of
the chiefs, Caraccioli made an harangue, in which
he told them, “that there was no rule could be laid
down which did not allow exceptions: that they
were all sensible how tender the Commodore
Monsieur Misson was in shedding blood; and that
it was a tenet of his faith, that none had power over
the life of another, but God alone who gave it; but
notwithstanding, self-preservation sometimes made
it absolutely necessary to take away the life of
another, especially an avowed and obliged enemy,
even in cold blood. As to the blood shed in a lawful
war, in defence of that liberty they had generously
asserted, it was needless to say any thing,
but he thought it proper to lay before them reasons
for the execution of the criminals, and the heinousness
of their crimes. They had not only received
their lives from the bounty of the Libertatians, but
their liberty, and had every thing restored them
which they laid claim to; consequently their ingratitude
rose in proportion to the generous treatment
they had met with: that indeed, both he and Capt.
Misson would have passed by the perjury and
ingratitude which they had been guilty of, with a
corporeal punishment, which had not extended to
the deprivation of life, but their gallant friend and
companion, the English commander, Capt. Tew,
used such cogent reasons for an exemplary punishment,
to deter others from the like crimes, that they
must have been enemies to their own preservation in
not following his advice: that the lives of their whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>body ought to be preferred to those of declared and
perjured enemies, who would not cease to endeavour
their ruin; and, as they were well acquainted
with their settlement, might be fatal instruments of
it, if they were again restored to that liberty which
they had already abused: that he was obliged to do
Capt. Tew the justice, to acknowledge he was
inclined to the side of mercy, till he was thoroughly
informed of the blackness of their ingratitude, and
then he thought it would be cruelty to themselves
to let those miscreants experience a second time
their clemency. Thus an absolute necessity had
obliged them to act contrary to their declared principles;
though, to state the case rightly, these men,
not the Libertarians, were the authors of their own
deaths.” Here the assembly crying out, “<em>their
blood is on their own heads, they sought their deaths,
and hanging is too good for them</em>;” Caraccioli gave
over, and every one returned satisfied to his private
or the public affairs.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some difference arising between Misson’s and
Tew’s men, on a national quarrel, which the latter
began, Capt. Tew proposed their deciding the quarrel
by the sword; but Caraccioli was entirely against
it, alleging, that such decision must necessarily
be a damage to the public, since the brave men
who fell, would be weakening of their colony. He
therefore desired Capt. Tew to interpose the authority
he had over his crew, and he and Misson would
endeavour to bring their men to an amicable agreement;
and for the future, as this accident proved
the necessity, wholesome laws should be made, and
a form of government entered upon. Both parties
were therefore called, and Caraccioli showed them
the necessity of their living in unity among themselves,
who had the whole world for enemies; and
as he had a persuasive and insinuating way of
argument, with the assistance of Capt. Tew, this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>affair was ended to the satisfaction of both parties.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next day the whole colony was assembled,
and the three commanders proposed a form of government
as necessary to their conservation; for
where there was no coercive laws, the weakest
would always be the sufferers, and every thing
must tend to confusion: that men’s passions, blinding
them to justice, and making them ever partial
to themselves, they ought to submit the differences
which might rise to calm and disinterested persons
who could examine with temper, and determine
according to reason and equity: that they looked
upon a democratical form, where the people were
themselves the makers and judges of their own
laws, the most agreeable; and therefore, desired
they would divide themselves into companies of ten
men, and every such company choose one to assist
in settling a form of government, and in making
wholesome laws for the good of the whole: that the
treasure and cattle they were masters of should be
equally divided, and such lands as any particular
man would enclose, should, for the future, be deemed
his property, which no other should lay any
claim to, if not alienated by a sale.</p>

<p class='c000'>This proposal was received with applause, and
they decimated themselves that very day, but put
off the meeting of the states till a house was built,
which they set about very cheerfully, and finished
it in about a fortnight; it being of framed timber,
and they having among them a great number who
understood the handling of an axe.</p>

<p class='c000'>When this body of politicians met, Caraccioli
opened the sessions with a handsome speech, showing
the advantage flowing from order; and then
spoke to the necessity of lodging a supreme power
in the hands of one who should have that of rewarding
brave and virtuous actions, and of punishing the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>vicious, according to the laws which the state
should make; by which he was to be guided: that
such a power, however, should not be for life, nor
be hereditary, but determine at the end of three
years, when a new choice should be made by the
state, or the old confirmed for three years longer;
by which means, the ablest men would always be at
the head of affairs, and their power being of short
duration, none would dare to abuse it: that such a
chief should have the title of <em>Lord Conservator</em>, and
all the ensigns of royalty to attend him.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was approved <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nem. con.</span></i> and Misson was
chosen conservator, with power to create great
officers, &amp;c. and with the title of <em>Supreme Excellence</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>A law was then made for the meeting of the
State once every year at least, but oftener, if the
conservator and his council thought it necessary
for the common good to convene them; and that
nothing of moment should be undertaken without
the approbation of the State.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a word their first session lasted ten days; and
a great many wholesome laws were enacted, registered
in the state book, and dispersed among
the crews.</p>

<p class='c000'>Capt. Tew, the conservator honoured with the
title of Admiral, and Caraccioli was made Secretary
of State. He chose a council of the ablest
among them, without distinction of nation or colour;
and the different languages began to be incorporated,
and one made out of the many. An equal
division was made of their treasure and cattle, and
every one began either to enclose land for himself,
or his neighbour who would hire his assistance.</p>

<p class='c000'>Admiral Tew proposed building an arsenal, and
augmenting their naval force. The first was agreed
to be proposed to the State at the next convention;
but the latter was thought unnecessary, till the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>number of inhabitants was augmented; for, should
they all be employed in the sea service, the husbandry
would be neglected, which would be of fatal
consequence to the growing colony.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Admiral then proposed the fetching in those
Englishmen who had followed the quarter-master;
but the council rejected this, alleging, that as they
deserted their captain, it was a mark of a mutinous
temper, and they might infect others with a spirit
of disorder; that, however, they might have notice
given them of the settlement, and if they made it
their earnest entreaty to be admitted, and would
desert the quarter-master, it should be granted as
a particular favour done them, at the instance of
the Admiral, and upon his engaging his parole of
honour for their quiet behaviour.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Admiral then desired he might take a cruise;
that he hoped to meet with some East-India ships,
and bring in some volunteers, for the number of
subjects being the riches of a nation, he thought
the colony stood more in need of men, than of any
thing else; that he would lie in the way of the
Cape, and did not question doing good service;
and as he went to the northward, would call upon
his own men.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Victoire was according to the Admiral’s
desire fitted out, and in a few days he sailed with
300 men on board. He came to an anchor at the
settlement his men had made, hoisted an English
ensign in his fore shrouds, and fired a gun; but
after he had waited some time, perceiving no signal
from the shore, he landed and sent back his boat.
Soon after the boat returned towards the ship, two
of his men came up to him, to whom he gave an
account of Misson’s settlement. They invited him
into the wood to see that of theirs, and to advise
with their companions, about the proposed migration.
The governor, alias quarter-master, received
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>him mighty civilly, but told him, that he could see
no advantage to themselves in changing their
present situation, though they might prove a great
one to the new colony, by adding to their force so
many brave fellows: that they there enjoyed all
the necessaries of life; were free and independent
of all the world; and it would be madness again to
subject themselves to any government, which,
however mild, still exerted some power. That he
was governor for three months, by the choice of his
companions; but his power extended no farther
than to the judging in matters of small difference
which might arise, which he hoped to do impartially
while his authority continued; that they had
agreed among themselves, and confirmed that
agreement by oath to support the decrees of the
governor for the time, that their tranquility might
not be disturbed by the humour of any one man:
and that this power of determining, was to devolve
at the expiration of three months, to him on whom
the lot should fall by balloting, provided he had not
before enjoyed the honour, for such a one was not
to draw; by which agreement, every one would be
raised, in time, to the supreme command, which
prevented all canvassing and making interest for
votes, as when determined by suffrage; left no
opening for making divisions and parties, and was a
means to continue to them that repose inseparable
from an unity among themselves. However, continued
he, “if you will go to America or Europe,
and show the advantage which may accrue to the
English, by fixing a colony here, out of that love we
bear our country, and to wipe away the odious
appellation of pirates, with pleasure we will submit
to any who shall come with a commission from a
lawful government; but it is ridiculous to think we
will become subjects to greater rogues than ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>Capt. Tew finding the quarter-master spoke the
sentiments of his companions, took leave, and
returned to his ship: but went on shore again in
the evening, the wind not serving to weigh, it
blowing due west. He asked the governor how he
got acquainted with the natives? He answered,
by meeting them a hunting, and using them well:
that he wheedled one of them down to their huts,
the fellow being alone, and they three in company,
he supposed, thought it best to go with seeming
willingness. After him several came, and they
lived very friendly with them. The captain, had
brought ashore with him some rum and brandy,
and they were drinking a bowl of punch, when
on a sudden, a violent storm arose. Capt. Tew ran
to the shore, and made a signal for his boat to carry
him off, but the sea ran too high to venture out
of the ship. The storm all the while increased,
and the Victoire, in less than two hours, parting
her cables, was driven ashore where it was very
steep, and perished, with all her men, in Capt.
Tew’s sight.</p>

<p class='c000'>The captain stayed with his old companions,
without knowing which way to return to his friends
he had left with Misson, not one of whom was
(luckily for them,) on board the ship. At the end of
three months they saw a large ship, which Tew believed
was the Bijoux; but she took no notice of the
fires they made. As he expected she would return
after a short cruise, he, and his companions, made
large fires every night on the shore, and visited the
coast very often. About a month after this, as they
came early to the sea-side, they were surprised at
the sight of two sloops which lay at anchor, about
a cannon shot from the shore. They had not been
long looking upon them, when a canoe was hoisted
out of one, and made to them, with six men who
rowed, and one sitter.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>Tew soon knew him to be Capt. Misson. He
came ashore, and embracing the former, told him,
all their proposed happiness was vanished; for
without the least provocation given, in the dead of
the night, the natives came down upon them in two
great bodies, and made a great slaughter, without
distinction of age or sex, before they could put
themselves in a posture of defence; that Caraccioli
(who died in the action) and he, got what men together
they could, to make a stand; but finding all
resistance vain against such numbers, he made a
shift to secure a considerable quantity of rough
diamonds and bar gold, and to get on board the two
sloops with 45 men: that the Bijoux being gone to
cruise, and the number of men he had carried with
him in the Victoire, had weakened the colony, and
given the natives the boldness to attack them, but
for what reason he could not imagine.</p>

<p class='c000'>Tew gave him an account of the disaster which
had happened, and after having mutually condoled
their misfortunes, Tew proposed their going to
America, where Misson might, with the riches he
had, pass his life unknown, and in a comfortable
manner. Misson answered he could not yet take
any resolution, though he had thoughts of returning
to Europe, and privately visiting his family, if
any were alive, and then retire from the world.
They dined with the quarter-master, who pressed
their return to America, to procure a commission
for the settling a colony. Misson told Tew, he
should have one of the sloops, and what volunteers
would keep him company, for his misfortunes had
erased all thoughts of future settlements; that
what riches they had saved, he would distribute
equally, nay, he would be content, if he had only a
bare support left him. On this answer, four of the
quarter-master’s company offered to join Capt. Tew.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the afternoon they visited both sloops, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>Misson putting the question to the men, 30 went on
board of one sloop, though they parted with great
reluctance from their old commander; and 15 stayed
with Misson. The four men who joined Tew
made the number of his crew 34: they stayed about
a week, in hopes of the Bijoux’s return upon the
coast; but she not appearing, they set sail, Captain
Misson having first shared the treasure, with Tew
and his other friends and companions, hoping to
meet the Bijoux on the Guinea coast, for which
they shaped their course. Off Cape Infantes, they
were overtaken with a storm, in which the unhappy
Misson’s sloop went down, within musket shot
of Capt. Tew, who could give him no assistance.</p>

<p class='c000'>Tew continued his course for America, and arrived
at Rhode-Island without any accident. His
men dispersed themselves, as they thought fit, and
Tew sent to Bermuda for his owner’s account,
fourteen times the value of their sloop; and not
being questioned by any, lived in great tranquillity.
The French belonging to Misson, took different
routes, one of whom dying at Rochelle, the French
manuscript of Misson’s life was found among his
papers, and transmitted to me by a friend and
correspondent.</p>

<p class='c000'>Capt. Tew lived unquestioned. He had an easy
fortune, and designed to live quietly at home; but
those of his men, who lived near him, having
squandered their shares, were continually soliciting
him to take another trip. He withstood their request
a considerable time; but they having got together
(by the report they made of the vast riches
to be acquired) a number of resolute fellows, they,
in a body, begged him to head them but for one voyage.
They were so earnest in their desire, that he
could not refuse complying. They prepared a small
sloop, and made the best of their way to the straits
entering the Red Sea, where they met with, and attacked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>a ship belonging to the Great Mogul in the
engagement, a shot carried away the rim of Tew’s
belly, who held his bowels with his hands some
small space. When he dropped, it struck such a
terror in his men, that they suffered themselves to
be taken, without further resistance.</p>

<h3 id='HALSEY' class='c007'>CAPTAIN JOHN HALSEY.</h3>

<p class='c008'>John Halsey was a Boston man, of New-England,
commanded the Charles, brigantine, and went
out with a commission from the governor, to cruise
on the banks of Newfoundland, where he took a
French banker, which he appointed to meet him at
Fayal; but missing his prize here, he went among
the Canary Islands, where he took a Spanish barcalonga,
which he plundered and sunk: from thence
he went to the island of Bravo, one of the Cape-de-Verds,
where he wooded and watered, turned ashore
his lieutenant, and several of his men here running
away from him, the governor sent them on board
again, his commission being as yet in force. From
hence he stood away to the southward, and doubling
the Cape of Good Hope, made for Madagascar
and the bay of Augustin, where he took in wood and
water, with some straggling seamen, who were cast
away in the Degrave Indiamen, Capt. Young, commander.
After this, he shaped his course for the
Red Sea, and met with a Dutchman of 60 guns,
coming from Mocha, whom he kept company with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>a week. Though he was resolved upon turning pirate,
he intended to rob only the Moor ships, which
occasioned a dispute between him and his men;
they insisting on the ship’s being a Moor, and he
asserting she was Dutch, was positive in his resolve
of meddling with no European ships. The
men were for boarding, but his obstinacy not being
to be conquered, they broke Halsey and his gunner,
confined both, and were ready to board the
Dutchman, when one of the crew perceiving he was
about to run out his lower tier, knocked down the
quarter-master (whose business it is to be at the
helm, in time of chase or engagement, according to
the rules of pirates) clapped the helm hard aweather,
and wore the brigantine. The Dutchman stayed,
and fired a shot, which taking a swivel gun, carried
it aft, narrowly missed the man at helm, and shattered
the taffarel. The men perceiving they had
caught a Tartar, made the best of their way to
shake her off, and some were running down between
decks, whom the surgeon pricked up again
with his sword, though he was no way consenting
to their designed piracy. The captain and gunner
were again reinstated after they had seen their mistake,
and then they steered for the Nicobar Islands,
where they met with a country ship, called the
Buffalo, commanded by Capt. Buckley, an Englishman,
coming from Bengal, which they took after a
short engagement there being only three Europeans
on board, the captain and two mates; the rest were
Moors. This ship fell seasonably in their way, she
being bound for Achen, with butter, rice, and cloth,
and the pirates, at that time, were in great straits
both for provision and clothing. They took the
two mates to sea with them, but left the captain
and the Moors at Cara Nicobar, at an anchor, and
then took a cruise. Capt. Buckley, who was sick,
died before their return. In the cruise they met
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>Captain Collins, in a country sloop, bound also to
Achen. He had also two English mates with him,
but the rest of his company consisted of Moors.
Him they carried to the same harbour where they
left the Buffalo.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here a dispute arose among the pirates. Some
were for returning to the West-Indies, others were
against it, for they had got no money, and that was
what engaged their search. They parted upon
this; one part went on board the Buffalo, made one
Rowe captain, and Myers, a Frenchman, master,
whom they had picked up at Madagascar. The
sloop’s deck they ripped up, and mended with it the
bottom of the brigantine which Halsey still commanded.
The ship shaped her course for Madagascar,
and the brigantine made for the straits of Malacca,
to lie in the track of the Manilla ships. I
must observe, that Capt. Buckley’s two mates,
whom they intended to force with them, were by
strength of entreaty, permitted to go away with a
canoe. In these straits, they met an European built
ship, of 26 guns, which they had not the courage
to attack, being soured by the Dutchman. They
afterwards stood in shore, and came to an anchor.
A few days after they made a vessel, which they
supposed a China junk, and gave chase, but when
they came pretty nigh, notwithstanding the pilot assured
them she was what they supposed, they swore
it was a Dutchman, and would not venture upon
him; so leaving off their chase they stood in shore,
and came again to an anchor under the peninsula.
They lay here some days, and then spied a tall vessel,
which they chased, and which proved to be the
Albemarle East-Indiamen, Capt. Bews, commander,
coming from China. They came up with him,
but thinking it too warm a ship after exchanging a
few shot, the brigantine made off, and the Albemarle
chased in her turn. They however got clear, having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>a better share of heels, and came again to an
anchor. Having not above 40 hands, the water
growing scarce, and not daring to venture ashore
for fear of the Dutch, a council was called, and it
was resolved to make the best of their way to Madagascar,
to pick up more hands, refresh, and set out
on new adventures. Pursuant to this resolution,
they steered for that island, but fell in their way on
Mascarenhas, where, making a small present to the
governor, they were supplied with what they wanted.
From hence they went to a place on Madagascar,
called by the pirates Hopeful Point; by the natives,
Harangby, near the island of St. Mary’s in the
lat. of 17, 40, S. where they met with the Buffalo,
and the Dorothy, a prize, made by Capt. Thomas
White and his company, being about 90 or 100
men, settled near the same place, in petty governments
of their own, having some of them 5 or 600,
some 1000 negro subjects, who acknowledged their
sovereignty. Here they again repaired their brigantine,
took in provisions and all necessaries, augmented
their company to about 100 men, and set
out for the Red Sea. They touched at Johanna, and
there took in a quantity of goats and cocoa nuts for
fresh provisions, and thence in eleven days reached
the Straits of Babelmandel. They had not cruised
here many days, when they spied the Moorish fleet
from Mocha and Jufa, consisting of 25 sail, which
they fell in with, and had been taken, if their oars
had not helped them off, it falling a dead calm.
They had not apprehended the danger so great, if
they had not judged these ships convoyed by some
Portuguese men of war. Some days after this, they
met a one mast vessel, called a grab, coming from
Mocha, which they spied within gun-shot in a thick
fog: they fired a shot which cut her halliards, and
then took possession of her with their boats. She
was laden with drugs, but they took only some necessaries
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>and 2000 dollars; and having learned that
four English vessels lay at Mocha, of which one
was from Jufa, they let her go.</p>

<p class='c000'>Three days after they spied the four ships, which
they at first took to be the trees of Babelmandel.
At night they fell in with, and kept them company
till morning, the trumpets sounding on both sides
all the time, for the pirate had two on board as well
as the English. When it was clear day, the four
ships drew into a line, for they had hailed the pirate,
who made no ceremony of owning who he was, by
an answering according to their manner, <em>From the
seas</em>. The brigantine bore up till she had slung her
gaff. One of the ships perceiving this, advised
Capt. Jago, who led the van, in a ship of 24 guns
and 70 men, to give chase, for the pirate was on the
run; but a mate, who was acquainted with the way
of working among pirates, answered he would find
his mistake, and said he had seen many a warm
day, but feared this would be the hottest. The brigantine
turned up again, and coming astern, clapped
the Rising Eagle aboard, a ship of 16 guns, and the
sternmost. Though they entered their men, the Rising
Eagle held them a warm dispute for three quarters
of an hour, in which Capt. Chamberlain’s chief
mate and several others were killed, the purser
was wounded, jumped overboard and drowned. In
the mean while the other ships called to Capt. Jago
to board the pirate; who bearing away to clap him
aboard, the pirate gave him a shot, which raked him
fore and aft, and determined Capt. Jago to get out
of danger; for he run away with all the sail he could
pack, though he was fitted out to protect the coast
against pirates. His example was followed by the
rest, every one steering a different coast. Thus
they became masters of the Rising Eagle. I cannot
but take notice, that the second mate of the Rising
Eagle, after quarters were called for, fired from out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>the forecastle, and killed two of the pirates, one of
whom was the gunner’s consort, who would have
revenged his death by shooting the mate, but several
Irish and Scots, together with one Captain Thomas
White, once a commander among the pirates,
but then a private man, interposed and saved him,
in regard that he was an Irishman. They examined
the prisoners to know which was the ship from Jufa,
that had money on board; and having learned it was
the Essex, they gave chase, came up with her, hoisted
the bloody flag at the main-mast-head, fired one
single gun, and she struck, though she was fitted
for close quarters, and there was not on board the
brigantine above 20 hands, and the prize was astern
so far, that her top-mast scarce appeared out of the
water. In chasing this ship, they passed the other
two, who held the fly of their ensigns in their hands
ready to strike. When the ship had struck, the captain
of her asked, who commanded the brigantine?
He was answered, Capt. Halsey. Asking again,
who was quarter-master? He was told Nathaniel
North, to whom he called, as he knew him very
well. North, learning his name was Punt, said,
<em>Capt. Punt, I am sorry you are fallen into our hands</em>.
He was civilly treated, and nothing belonging to
himself or the English gentlemen, who were passengers,
touched, though they made bold to lay hands
on £40,000 in money, belonging to the ship. They
had about £10,000 in money out of the Rising Eagle.
They discharged the Essex, and with the other
prize and the brigantine, steered for Madagascar,
where they arrived and shared their booty. Some
of the passengers, who had been so well treated,
came afterwards with a small ship from India (with
license from the governor of Madras) called the
Greyhound, laden with necessaries, in hopes to barter
with the pirates for the dry goods they had taken,
and recover them at an easy rate. They were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>received very kindly, an invoice of their goods was
asked, the goods agreed for, shared and paid in money
and bale goods. In the mean while came in a
ship from Scotland, called the Neptune, 26 guns, 54
men, commanded by Capt. Miller, with a design to
slave, and to go thence to Batavia to dispose of her
negroes (having a supercargo on board, brought up
among the Dutch) and thence to Malacca, to take
on board the cargo of a ship, called the Speedwell,
lost on her return from China; but finding here
another ship trading with the pirates, and having
many necessaries, French brandy, Madeira wine,
and English stout on board, Capt. Miller thought
it better to trade for money than slaves. The merchants
of the Greyhound, nettled to see any but
themselves take money, for the pirates never haggled
about a price, told them, <em>They could not do
the governor of Madras a more grateful piece of service
than to make prize of the Neptune, which was a
ship fit for that purpose</em>. To which some of the
Scotch and Irish answered, <em>They had not best put
such a design on foot, for if the company once got
it into their heads to take one, they would go nigh to
take both ships</em>. In a short time after came on a
hurricane, which obliged the Neptune to cut away
all her masts, and lost the three ships belonging to
the pirates, which was their whole fleet. They having
now no ship, and several of them no money,
having been stripped at play, their thoughts were
bent on the Neptune. The chief mate of her, Daniel
Burgess, who had a spleen to the captain, joining
privately with the pirates (among whom he died)
got all the small masts and yards ashore; and the
pirates being requested to find him proper trees
for masting, told Capt. Miller they had found such
as would serve his turn, desiring he would take a
number of hands ashore to get them down to the
water, which (he suspecting no harm) accordingly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>did, and he and his men were seized, and the long-boat
detained ashore. The captain was forced to
send for the second mate, and afterwards for the
gunner; the mate, who was the captain’s brother,
went, but the gunner, suspecting foul play, refused.
In the evening, Burgess came on board, and advised
the surrender of the ship, which, though but
sixteen were left on board, they scrupled, and
proposed going under the cover of their own guns
to fetch their top-mast and yards, and with them
put to sea; but the chief mate, Burgess, whose villany
was not then known, persuaded them to give
up a ship they could neither defend nor sail; which
was no small satisfaction to the Greyhound, little
thinking how soon they would meet with the same
treatment; for two days after, the pirates manned
the Neptune’s pinnace, seized the Greyhound, took
away all the money they had paid, and shifting out
of the Neptune ten pipes of Madeira, with two
hogsheads of brandy, into the Greyhound, and putting
on board the captain, second mate, boatswain
and gunner of the Neptune, and about fourteen of
her hands, ordered her to sea. The rest of the
Neptune’s company being young men fit for their
purpose, they detained, most of whom, by hard
drinking, fell into distempers and died. As to Capt.
Halsey, while the Scotch ship was fitting, he fell
ill of a fever, died and was buried with great solemnity
and ceremony; the prayers of the church of
England was read over him, colours were flying,
and his sword and pistol laid on his coffin, which
was covered with a ship’s jack; as many minute
guns fired as he was years old, viz. 46, and three
English volleys, and one French volley of small
arms. He was brave in his person, courteous
to all his prisoners, lived beloved, and died regretted
by his own people. His grave was made
in a garden of water-melons, and fenced in with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>palisades to prevent his being rooted up by the
wild hogs, of which there are plenty in those
parts.</p>

<p class='c000'>P. S. The Neptune seized as above, was the year
after Capt. Halsey’s death, ready to go to sea; but
a hurricane happening, she was lost, and proved
the last ship that gang of pirates ever got possession
of.</p>

<h3 id='WHITE' class='c007'>CAPTAIN THOMAS WHITE.</h3>

<p class='c008'>He was born at Plymouth, where his mother
kept a public house. She took great care of his
education, and when he was grown up, as he had
an inclination to the sea, procured him the king’s
letter. After he had served some years on board a
man of war, he went to Barbadoes, where he married,
got into the merchant service, and designed
to settle in the island. He had the command of
the Marygold brigantine given him, in which he
made two successful voyages to Guinea and back
to Barbadoes. In his third, he had the misfortune
to be taken by a French pirate, as were several
other English ships, the masters and inferior officers
of which they detained, being in want of good
artists. The brigantine belonging to White, they
kept for their own use, and sunk the vessel they
before sailed in; but meeting with a ship on the
Guinea coast more fit for their purpose, they went
on board her, and burnt the brigantine.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is not my business here to give an account of
this French pirate, any farther than Capt. White’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>story obliges me, though I beg leave to take notice
of their barbarity to the English prisoners, for they
would set them up as a butt or mark to shoot at;
several of whom were thus murdered in cool
blood, by way of diversion.</p>

<p class='c000'>White was marked out for a sacrifice by one of
these villains, who, for I know not what reason,
had sworn his death which he escaped thus. One
of the crew, who had a friendship for White, knew
this fellow’s design to kill him in the night, and
therefore advised him to lie between him and the
ship’s side, with intention to save him; which indeed
he did, but was himself shot dead by the murderous
villain, who mistook him for White.</p>

<p class='c000'>After some time cruising along the coast, the
pirates doubled the Cape of Good Hope, and shaped
their course for Madagascar, where, being drunk
and mad, they knocked their ship on the head, at
the south end of the island, at a place called by the
natives Elexa. The country thereabouts was governed
by a king, named Mafaly.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the ship struck, Capt. White, Capt. Boreman,
(born in the Isle of Wight, formerly a lieutenant
of a man of war, but in the merchant’s service
when he fell into the hands of the pirates) Capt.
Bowen and some other prisoners, got into the
long-boat, and with broken oars and barrel staves,
which they found in the bottom of the boat, paddled
to Augustin Bay, which is about 14 or 15
leagues from the wreck, where they landed, and
were kindly received by the king of Bavaw (the
name of that part of the island) who spoke good
English.</p>

<p class='c000'>They stayed here a year and a half at the king’s
expense, who gave them a plentiful allowance of
provision, as was his custom to all white men, who
met with any misfortune on his coast. His humanity
not only provided for such, but the first European
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>vessel that came in, he always obliged to take
in the unfortunate people, let the vessel be what it
would; for he had no notion of any difference between
pirates and merchants.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the expiration of the above term, a pirate
brigantine came in, on board which the king obliged
them to enter, or travel by land to some other
place, which they durst not do; and of two evils
chose the least, that of going on board the pirate
vessel which was commanded by one William
Read, who received them very civilly.</p>

<p class='c000'>This commander went along the coast, and
picked up what Europeans he could meet with.
His crew, however, did not exceed forty men. He
would have been glad of taking on board some of
the wrecked Frenchmen, but for the barbarity
they had used towards the English prisoners.
However, it was impracticable, for the French
pretending to lord it over the natives, whom they
began to treat inhumanly, were set upon by them,
one half of their number cut off, and the other half
made slaves.</p>

<p class='c000'>Read, with this gang, and a brigantine of 60 tons,
steered his course for the gulf of Persia, where they
met a grab (a one masted vessel) of about 200 tons,
which was made prize. They found nothing on
board but bale goods, most of which they threw
overboard to search for gold, and to make room in
the vessel; but as they learned afterwards, they
threw over, in their search, what they so greedily
hunted after, for there was a considerable quantity
of gold concealed in one of the bales they tossed
into the sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this cruise Capt. Read fell ill and died, and was
succeeded by one James. The brigantine being
small, crazy, and worm-eaten, they shaped their
course for the island of Mayotta, where they took
out the masts of the brigantine, fitted up the grab,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>and made a ship of her. Here they took in a quantity
of fresh provisions, which are<a id='t107'></a> in this island very
plentiful, and very cheap; and found a twelve oared
boat, which formerly belonged to the Ruby East-Indiamen,
which had been lost there.</p>

<p class='c000'>They stayed here all the monsoon time, which
is about six months; after which they resolved for
Madagascar. As they came in with the land, they
spied a sail coming round from the East side of the
island. They gave chase on both sides, so that
they soon met. They hailed each other, and receiving
the same answer from each vessel, viz. <em>from
the seas</em>, they joined company.</p>

<p class='c000'>This vessel was a small French ship, laden with
liquors from Martinico, first commanded by one
Fourgette, to trade with the pirates for slaves, at
Ambonawoula, on the East side of the island, in the
lat. of 17 degrees 30 minutes and was by them
taken after the following manner.</p>

<p class='c000'>The pirates, who were headed by George Booth,
now commander of the ship, went on board (as
they had often done) to the number of ten, and carried
money with them, under pretence of purchasing
what they wanted. This Booth had formerly
been gunner of a pirate ship, called the Dolphin.
Capt. Fourgette was pretty much upon his guard,
and searched every man as he came over the side,
and a pair of pocket pistols were found upon a
Dutchman, who was the first entered. The captain
told him, <em>he was a rogue, and had a design upon
his ship</em>, and the pirates pretended to be so angry
with this fellow’s offering to come on board with
arms, that they threatened to knock him on the
head, and tossingly him rough into the boat, ordered
him ashore, though they had before taken an
oath on the bible, either to carry the ship or die
in the undertaking.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were all searched, but they however contrived
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>to get on board four pistols, which were all
the arms they had for the enterprise, though Fourgette
had 20 hands on board, and his small arms
on the awning, to be in readiness.</p>

<p class='c000'>The captain invited them into the cabin to dinner,
but Booth chose to dine with the petty officer
though one Johnson, Isaac, and another, went down.
Booth was to give the watch-word, which was
<em>hurrah</em>. Standing near the awning, and being a
nimble fellow, at one spring threw himself upon
it, drew the arms to him, fired his pistol forward
among the men, one of whom he wounded, (who
jumping overboard was lost) and gave the signal.</p>

<p class='c000'>Three, I said, were in the cabin, and seven upon
deck, who with handspikes and the arms seized,
secured the ship’s crew. The captain and his two
mates, who were at dinner in the cabin, hearing the
pistol, fell upon Johnson, and stabbed him in several
places with their forks, but they being silver did
him no great damage. Fourgette snatched his
piece, which he snapped at Isaac’s breast several
times, but it would not go off. At last, finding his
resistance vain, he submitted, and the pirates set
him, and those of his men, who would not join them,
on shore, allowing him to take his books, papers,
and whatever else he claimed as belonging to him
self; and besides treating him very humanely, gave
him several casks of liquor, with arms and powder
to purchase provisions in the country.</p>

<p class='c000'>I hope this digression, as it was in a manner
needful, will be excused. I shall now proceed.</p>

<p class='c000'>After they had taken in the Dolphin’s company,
which were on the island, and increased their crew,
by that means, to the number of 80 hands, they
sailed to St. Mary’s, where Capt. Mosson’s ship lay
at anchor, between the island and the main. This
gentleman and his whole ship’s company had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>cut off, at the instigation of Ort Van Tyle, a Dutchman
of New-York.</p>

<p class='c000'>Out of her they took water casks and other
necessaries; which having done, they designed for
the river Methelage. On the west side of Madagascar,
in the lat. of 16 degrees or thereabouts, to
salt up provisions and to proceed to the East-Indies,
cruise off the islands of St. John, and lie in
wait for the Moor ships from Mocha.</p>

<p class='c000'>In their way to Methelage they fell in (as I have
said) with the pirate, on board of which was Capt.
White. They joined company, came to an anchor
together in the above named river, where they had
cleaned, salted, and taken in their provisions, and
were ready to go to sea, when a large ship appeared
in sight, and stood into the same river.</p>

<p class='c000'>The pirates knew not whether she was a merchantman
or man of war. She had been the latter,
belonging to the French king, and could mount 50
guns; but being taken by the English, she was
bought by some London merchants, and fitted out
from that port to slave at Madagascar, and go to
Jamaica. The captain was a young, inexperienced
man, who was put in with a nurse.</p>

<p class='c000'>The pirates sent their boats to speak with them,
but the ship firing at them, they concluded it a
man of war, and rowed ashore; the grab standing
in, and not keeping her wind so well as the French
built ship, run among a parcel of mangroves, and a
stump piercing her bottom, she sunk: the other run
aground, let go her anchor, and came to no damage,
for the tide of flood fetched her off.</p>

<p class='c000'>The captain of the Speaker, for that was the
name of the ship which frightened the pirates, was
not a little vain of having forced these two vessels
ashore, though he did not know whether they were
pirates or merchantmen, and could not help expressing
himself in these words: “How will my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>name ring on the exchange, when it is known I
have run two pirates aground;” which gave handle
to a satirical return from one of his men after he
was taken, who said, “Lord! how our captain’s
name will ring on the exchange; when it is heard,
he frightened two pirate ships ashore, and was taken
by their two boats afterwards.”</p>

<p class='c000'>When the Speaker came within shot, she fired
several times at the two vessels; and when she
came to an anchor, several more into the country,
which alarmed the negroes, who, acquainting their
king, he would allow him no trade, till the pirates
living ashore, and who had a design on his ship,
interceded for them, telling the king, they were
their countrymen, and what had happened was
through a mistake, it being a custom among them
to fire their guns by way of respect, and it was owing
to the gunner of the ship’s negligence that they
fired shot.</p>

<p class='c000'>The captain of the Speaker sent his purser
ashore, to go up the country to the king, who lived
about 24 miles from the coast, to carry a couple
of small arms inlaid with gold, a couple of brass
blunderbusses, and a pair of pistols, as presents,
and to require trade. As soon as the purser was
ashore, he was taken prisoner, by one Tom Collins,
a Welchman, born in Pembroke, who lived on shore,
and had belonged to the Charming Mary, of Barbadoes,
which went out with a commission but was
converted to a pirate. He told the purser he was
his prisoner, and must answer the damage done
to merchants who were slaving. The purser answered,
that he was not commander; that the
captain was a hot rash youth, put into business by
his friends, which he did not understand; but however,
satisfaction should be made. He was carried
by Collins on board Booth’s ship, where, at first, he
was talked to in pretty strong terms; but after a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>while very civilly used, and the next morning sent
up to the king with a guide, and peace made for
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>The king allowed them trade, and sent down the
usual presents, a couple of oxen between twenty
and thirty people laden with rice, and as many
more with the country liquor, called <em>toke</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The captain then settled the factory on the shore
side, and began to buy slaves and provisions. The
pirates were among them, and had opportunities of
sounding the men, and knowing in what posture the
ship lay. They found by one Hugh Man, belonging
to the Speaker, that there were not above 40 men
on board, and that they had lost the second mate
and 20 hands in the long-boat, on the coast, before
they came into this harbour, but that they kept a
good look out, and had their guns ready primed.
However, he, for a hundred pounds, undertook to
wet all the priming, and assist in taking the ship.</p>

<p class='c000'>After some days the captain of the Speaker came
on shore, and was received with a great deal of
civility by the heads of the pirates, having agreed
before to make satisfaction. In a day or two after,
he was invited by them to eat a barbecued shoat,
which invitation he accepted. After dinner, Capt.
Bowen, who was, I have already said, a prisoner
on board the French pirate, but now become one
of the fraternity, and master of the grab, went out,
and returned with a case of pistols in his hand,
and told the captain of the Speaker, whose name I
won’t mention, that he was his prisoner. He asked,
upon what account? Bowen answered, “they wanted
a ship, his was a good one, and they were resolved
to have her, to make amends for the damage
he had done them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In the mean while his boat’s crew, and the rest
of his men ashore, were told by others of the pirates,
who were drinking with them, that they were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>also prisoners: some of them answered, <em>Zound’,
we don’t trouble our heads what we are, let’s have
t’other bowl of punch</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>A watch word was given, and no boat to be admitted
on board the ship. This word, which was
for that night, <em>Coventry</em>, was known to them. At
8 o’clock they manned the twelve-oared boat, and
the one they found at Mayotta, with 24 men, and
set out for the ship. When they were put off, the
captain of the Speaker desired them to come back
as he wanted to speak with them. Capt. Booth
asked what he wanted! He said, “they could never
take his ship.” “Then,” said Booth, “we’ll die
in or along side of her.”—“But,” replied the captain,
“if you will go with safety, don’t board on
the larboard side for there is a gun out of the
steerage loaded with partridge, which will clear the
decks.” They thanked him, and proceeded.</p>

<p class='c000'>When they were near the ship they were hailed,
and the answer was, <em>the Coventry</em>. “All well,” said
the mate, “get the lights over the side;” but spying
the second boat, he asked what boat that was?
One answered, it was a raft of water; another that
it was a boat of beef; this disagreement in the answers
made the mate suspicious, who cried out—<em>Pirates,
take to your arms my lads</em>, and immediately
clapped a match to a gun, which, as the priming
was before wet by the treachery of Hugh Man,
only fizzed. They boarded in the instant, and
made themselves masters of her, without the loss
of a man on either side.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next day they put necessary provisions on
board the French built ship, and gave her to the
captain of the Speaker, and those men who would
go off with him, among whom was Man, who had
betrayed his ship; for the pirates had both paid him
the £100 agreed, and kept his secret. The captain
having thus lost his ship, sailed in that which the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>pirates gave him, for Johanna, where he fell ill and
died with grief.</p>

<p class='c000'>The pirates having here victualled, they sailed
for the Bay of St. Augustine where they took in
between 70 and 80 men, who had belonged to the
ship Alexander commanded by Capt. James, a pirate.
They also took up her guns, and mounted
the Speaker with 54, which made up their number
240 men, besides slaves, of which they had
about 20.</p>

<p class='c000'>From hence they sailed for the East-Indies, but
stopped at Zanguebar for fresh provisions, where
the Portuguese had once a settlement, but now inhabited
by Arabians. Some of them went ashore
with the captain to buy provisions. The captain
was sent for by the governor, who went with about
14 in company. They passed through the guard,
and when they had entered the governor’s house,
they were all cut off; and, at the same time, others
who where in different houses of the town were set
upon, which made them fly to the shore. The long-boat,
which lay off a grappling, was immediately
put in by those who looked after her. There were
not above half a dozen of the pirates who brought
their arms ashore, but they plied them so well, for
they were in the boat, that most of the men got
into her. The quarter-master ran down sword in
hand, and though he was attacked by many, he behaved
himself so well, that he got into a little canoe,
put off, and reached the long-boat.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the interim, the little fort the Arabians had
played upon the ship, which returned the salute
very warmly. Thus they got on board, with the
loss of Capt. Booth and 20 men, and set sail for the
East-Indies. When they were under sail, they went
to voting for a new captain, and the quarter-master,
who had behaved so well in the last affair with the
Arabians, was chosen; but he declining all command,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>the crew made choice of Bowen for captain
Pickering to succeed him as master, Samuel Herault,
a Frenchman, for quarter-master, and Nathaniel
North for captain quarter-master.</p>

<p class='c000'>Things being thus settled, they came to the
mouth of the Red Sea, and fell in with 13 sail of
Moor ships, which they kept company with the
greater part of the day, but afraid to venture on
them, as they took them for Portuguese men of war
At length part were for boarding, and advised it.
The captain though he said little, did not seem inclined,
far he was but a young pirate, though an old
commander of a merchantman. Those who pushed
for boarding, then desired Capt. Boremen, already
mentioned, to take the command; but he said he
would not be an usurper; that nobody was more fit
for it than he who had it; that for his part he would
stand by his fuzil, and went forward to the forecastle
with such as would have him take the command,
to be ready to board; on which, the captain’s quarter-master
said, if they were resolved to engage,
their captain, (whose representative he was) did not
want resolution; therefore ordered them to get
their tacks on board (for they had already made a
clear ship) and get ready for boarding; which they
accordingly did, and coming up with the sternmost
ship, they fired a broadside into her, which killed
two Moors, clapped her on board and carried her;
but night coming on, they made only this prize,
which yielded them £500 per man. From hence
they sailed to the coast of Malabar. The adventures
of these pirates on this coast are already set
down in Captain Bowen’s life, to which I refer the
reader, and shall only observe, that Capt. White
was all this time before the mast, being a forced
man from the beginning.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bowen’s crew dispersing, Capt. White went to
Methelage, where he lived ashore with the King
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>not having an opportunity of getting off the island,
till another pirate ship, called the Prosperous, commanded
by one Howard, who had been bred a lighterman
on the river Thames, came in. This ship
was taken at Augustin, by some pirates from shore,
and the crew of their own long-boat, which joined
them, at the instigation of one Ranten, boatswain’s
mate, who sent for water. They came on board
in the night and surprised her, though not without
resistance, in which the captain and chief mate
were killed, and several others wounded.</p>

<p class='c000'>Those who were ashore with Capt. White, resolving
to enter in this ship, determined him to go
also, rather than be left alone with the natives,
hoping, by some accident or other, to have an opportunity
of returning home. He continued on
board this ship, in which he was made quarter-master,
till they met with, and all went on board of Bowen,
as is set down in his life, in which ship he continued
after Bowen left them. At Port Dolphin he
went off in the boats to fetch some of the crew left
ashore, the ship being blown to sea the night before.
The ship not being able to get in, and he supposing
her gone to the west side of the island, as they had
formerly proposed, he steered that course in his
boat with 26 men. They touched at Augustin, expecting
the ship, but she not appearing in a week, the
time they waited, the king ordered them to be gone,
telling them they imposed on him with lies, for he
did not believe they had any ship: however he gave
them fresh provision: they took in water, and made
for Methelage. Here as Capt. White was known
to the king, they were kindly received, and stayed
about a fortnight in expectation of the ship, but
she not appearing, they raised their boat a streak,
salted the provision the king gave them, put water
aboard, and stood for the north end of the island,
designing to go round, believing their ship might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>be at the island of St. Mary. When they came to
the north end, the current, which sets to the N. W.
for eight months in the year, was so strong they
found it impossible to get round. Wherefore they
got into a harbour, of which there are many for
small vessels. Here they stayed about three weeks
or a month, when part of the crew were for burning
the boat, and travelling over land to a black king of
their acquaintance, who name was Reberimbo,
who lived at a place called Manangaromasigh, in
lat. 15 deg. or thereabouts. As this king had been
several times assisted by the whites in his wars, he
was a great friend to them. Capt. White dissuaded
them from this undertaking, and with much ado,
saved the boat; but one half of the men being resolved
to go by land, they took what provisions they
thought necessary, and set out. Capt. White, and
those who stayed with him, convoyed them a day’s
journey, and then returning, he got into the boat
with his companions, and went back to Methelage,
fearing these men might return, prevail with the
rest, and burn the boat.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here he built a deck on his boat, and lay by three
months, in which time there came in three pirates
with a boat, who had formerly been trepanned on
board the Severn and Scarborough men of war,
which had been looking for pirates on the east side;
from which ships they made their escape at Mohila,
in a small canoe to Johanna, and from Johanna to
Mayotta, where the king built them the boat which
brought them to Methelage. The time of the current’s
setting with violence to the N. W. being over,
they proceeded together in White’s boat (burning
that of Mayotta) to the north end, where the current
running yet too strong to get round, they went
into a harbour and stayed there a month, maintaining
themselves with fish and wild hogs, of which
there was a great plenty. At length, having fine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>weather, and the strength of the current abating,
they got round; and after sailing about 40 miles on
the east side, they went into a harbour, where they
found a piece of a jacket, which they knew belonged
to one of those men who had left them to go
over land. He had been a forced man, and a ship
carpenter. This they supposed he had torn to wrap
round his feet: that part of the country being barren
and rocky. As they sailed along this coast,
they came to an anchor in convenient harbours
every night, till they got as far as Manangaromasigh,
where king Reberimbo resided, where
they went in to inquire for their men, who left them
at the north end, and to recruit with provisions.
The latter was given them, but they could get no
information of their companions.</p>

<p class='c000'>From hence they went to the island of St. Mary,
where a canoe came off to them with a letter
directed to any white man. They knew it to be
the hand of one of their former ship-mates. The
contents of this letter was to advise them to be on
their guard, and not trust too much to the blacks of
this place, they having been formerly treacherous.
They inquired after their ship, and were informed,
that the company had given her to the Moors, who
were gone away with her, and that they themselves
were settled at Amboynavoula, about 20 leagues to
the southward of St. Mary, where they lived among
the negroes as so many sovereign princes.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the blacks, who brought off the letter went
on board their boat, carried them to the place called
Olumbah, a point of land made by a river on one
side, and the sea on the other, where twelve of
them lived together in a large house they had built,
and fortified with about twenty pieces of cannon.</p>

<p class='c000'>The rest of them were settled in small companies
of about 12 or 14 together, more or less, up the
said river, and along the coast, every nation by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>itself, as the English, French, Dutch &amp;c. They
made inquiry of their consorts after the different
prizes which belonged to them, and they found all
very justly laid by to be given them, if ever they
returned, as were what belonged to the men who
went over land. Capt. White, hankering after
home, proposed going out again in the boat; for
he was averse to settling with them; and many
others agreed to go under his command; and if they
could meet with a ship to carry them to Europe,
to follow their old vocation. But the others did not
think it reasonable he should have the boat, but
that it should be set to sale for the benefit of the
company. Accordingly it was set up, and Capt.
White bought it for 400 pieces of eight, and with
some of his old consorts, whose number was increased
by others of the ship’s crew, he went back
the way he had come to Methelage. Here he met
with a French ship of about 50 tons, and 6 guns,
which had been taken by some pirates who lived at
Maratan, on the east side of the island, and some
of the Degrave East-Indiaman’s crew, to whom the
master of her refused a passage to Europe; for as
he had himself been a pirate, and quarter-master to
Bowen, in the Speaker, he apprehended their taking
away his ship. War then subsisting between
England and France, he thought they might do it
without being called in question as pirates. The
pirates who had been concerned in taking Herault’s
ship, for that was his name, had gone up the country,
and left her to the men belonging to the Degrave
who had fitted her up, cleaned and tallowed
her, and got in some provision, with a design to go
to the East-Indies, that they might light on some
ship to return to their own country.</p>

<p class='c000'>Capt. White, finding these men proposed joining
him, and going round to Ambonavoula, to make up
a company, it was agreed upon, and they unanimously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>chose him commander. They accordingly
put to sea, and stood away round the south end of
the island, and touched at Don Mascarenhas, where
he took in a surgeon, and stretching over again to
Madagascar, fell in with Ambonavoula, and made
up his complement of 60 men. From hence he
shaped his course for the island of Mayotta, where
he cleaned his ship, and waited for the season to
go into the Red Sea. His provisions being taken
in, the time proper, and the ship well fitted, he
steered for Babelmandel, and running into a harbour,
waited for the Mocha ships.</p>

<p class='c000'>He here took two grabs laden with provisions,
and having some small money and drugs aboard.
These he plundered of what was for his turn, kept
them a fortnight by him, and let them go. Soon after
they spied a lofty ship, upon which they put to sea;
but finding her European built, and too strong to
attempt, for it was a Dutchman, they gave over the
chase, and were glad to shake him off, and return
to their station. Fancying they were here discovered,
from the coast of Arabia, or that the grabs had
given information of them they stood over for the
Ethiopian shore, keeping a good look out for the
Mocha ships. A few days after, they met with a
large ship of about 1000 tons and 600 men, called
the Malabar, which they chased, kept company
with all night, and took in the morning, with the
loss of only their boatswain, and two or three men
wounded. In the taking this ship, they damaged
their own so much, by springing their foremast,
carrying away their bowsprit, and beating in part
of their upper works, that they did not think her longer
fit for their use. They therefore filled her with
prisoners, gave them provision and sent them away.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some days after this they spied a Portuguese
man of war of 44 guns, which they chased, but gave
it over, by carrying away their main-top-mast, so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>that they did not speak with her, for the Portuguese
took no notice of them. Four days after
they had left this man of war, they fell in with a
Portuguese merchantman, which they chased with
English colours flying. The chase, taking White
for an English man of war or East-Indiaman, made
no sail to get from him, but on his coming up,
brought to, and sent his boat on board with a present
of sweet-meats for the English captain. His
boat’s crew was detained, and the pirates getting
into his boat with their arms, went on board, and
fired on the Portuguese, who being surprised, asked
if war was broke out between England and
Portugal? They answered in the affirmative, but
the captain could not believe them. However they
took what they liked, and kept him with them.</p>

<p class='c000'>After two days they met with the Dorothy, an
English ship, Capt. Penruddock, commander, coming
from Mocha. They exchanged several shot in
the chase, but when they came along side of her,
they entered their men, and found no resistance,
she being navigated by Moors, no Europeans,
except the officers being on board. On a vote, they
gave Capt. Penruddock (from whom they took a
considerable quantity of money) the Portuguese
ship and cargo, with what bale he pleased to take
out of his own, bid him go about his business, and
make what he could of her. As to the English ship,
they kept her for their own use.</p>

<p class='c000'>Soon after, they plundered the Malabar ship, out
of which they took as much money as came to £200
sterling a man, but missed 50,000 sequins, which
were hid in a jar under a cow’s stall, kept for the
giving milk to the Moor supercargo, an ancient man.
They then put the Portuguese and Moor prisoners
on board the Malabar, and sent them about their
business. The day after they had sent them away,
one Capt. Benjamin Stacy, in a ketch of 6 guns fell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>into their hands. They took what money he had,
and what goods and provisions they wanted.
Among the money were 500 dollars, a silver mug
and two spoons belonging to a couple of children
on board, who were under the care of Stacy. The
children took on for their loss, and the captain asking
the reason of their tears, was answered by Stacy,
that the above sum and plate was all the children
had to bring them up. Capt. White made a
speech to his men, and told them it was cruel to rob
the innocent children; upon which, by unanimous
consent, all was restored them again. Besides, they
made a gathering among themselves, and made a
present to Stacy’s mate, and other of his inferior
officers, and about 120 dollars to the children.
They then discharged Stacy and his crew, and
made the best of their way out of the Red Sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>They came into the bay of Defarr, where they
found a ketch at anchor, which the people had made
prize of, by seizing the master and boat’s crew
ashore. They found a French gentleman, one
Monsieur Berger, on board, whom they carried
with them, took out about 2000 dollars, and sold
the ketch to the chief ashore for provision.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hence they sailed for Madagascar, but touched
at Mascarenhas, where several of them went
ashore with their booty, about £1200 a man.
Here taking in fresh provisions, White steered for
Madagascar, and fell in with Hopeful Point where
they shared their goods, and took up settlements
ashore, where White built a house, bought cattle,
took off the upper deck of his ship, and was fitting
her up for the next season. When she was near
ready for sea, Capt. John Halsey, who had made a
broken voyage, came in with a brigantine, which
being a more proper vessel for their turn, they
desisted from working on the ship, and those who
had a mind for fresh adventures, went on board
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>Halsey among whom Capt. White entered before
the mast.</p>

<p class='c000'>At his return to Madagascar, White was taken ill
of a flux, which in about five or six months ended
his days. Finding his time was drawing nigh, he
made his will, left several legacies, and named three
men of different nations, guardian to a son he had
by a woman of the country, requiring he might be
sent to England with the money he left him, by
the first English ship, to be brought up in the
Christian religion, in hopes he might live a better
man than his father. He was buried with the same
ceremony they used at the funerals of their companions,
which is mentioned in the account of
Halsey. Some years after, an English ship touching
there, the guardians faithfully discharged their
trust, and put him on board with the captain, who
brought up the boy with care, acting by him as
became a man of probity and honour.</p>

<h3 id='CONDENT' class='c007'>CAPTAIN CONDENT.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Captain Condent was a Plymouth man born,
but we are as yet ignorant of the motives and time
of his first turning pirate. He was one of those who
thought fit to retire from Providence, on Governor
Rogers’ arrival at that island, in a sloop belonging
to Mr. Simpson, of New-York, a Jew merchant of
which sloop he was then quarter-master. Soon after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>they left the island, an accident happened on
board, which put the whole crew into consternation.
They had among them an Indian man, whom some
of them had beat: in revenge, he got most of the
arms forward into the hold, and designed to blow
up the sloop; upon which, some advised scuttling
the deck and throwing grenade shells down; but
Condent said, that was too tedious and dangerous,
since the fellow might fire through the deck and
kill several of them. He, therefore, taking a pistol
in one hand, and his cutlass in the other, leaned into
the hold. The Indian discharged a piece at him,
which broke his arm; but, however, he ran up and
shot the Indian. When he was dead, the crew
hacked him to pieces, and the gunner, ripping up
his belly, tore out his heart, broiled and ate it.</p>

<p class='c000'>After this, they took a merchantman called the
Duke of York; and some disputes arising among
the pirates, the captain, and one half of the company,
went on board the prize; the other half, who
continued in the sloop, chose Condent captain. He
shaped his course for the Cape-de-Verd Islands,
and in his way took a merchant ship from Madeira,
laden with wine, bound for the West-Indies, which
he plundered and let go; then coming to the Isle
of May, one of the said islands, he took the whole
salt fleet, consisting of about 20 sail. Wanting a
boom, he took out the mainmast of one of these
ships to supply the want. Here he took upon himself
the administration of justice, inquiring into the
manner of the commanders behaviour to their men,
and those against whom complaint was made he
whipped and pickled. He took what provision and
other necessaries he wanted, and having augmented
his company by volunteers and forced men, he left
the ships and sailed to St. Jago, where he took a
Dutch ship, which had formerly been a privateer.
This proved also an easy prize, for he fired but one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>broadside, and clapping her on board, carried her
without resistance, for the captain and several men
were killed, and some wounded by his great shot.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ship proving for his purpose, he gave her
the name of the Flying Dragon, went on board with
his crew, and made a present of his sloop to a mate
of an English prize, whom he had forced with him.
From hence he stood away for the coast of Brazil,
and in his cruise took several Portuguese ships,
which he plundered and let go.</p>

<p class='c000'>After these, he fell in with the Wright galley,
Capt. John Spelt, commander, hired by the South
Sea company, to go to the coast of Angola for
slaves, and thence to Buenos Ayres. This ship he
detained a considerable time, and the captain being
his townsman, treated him very civilly. A few days
after he took Spelt, he made prize of a Portuguese,
laden with bale goods and stores. He new rigged
the Wright galley, and put on board of her some of
the goods. Soon after he had discharged the Portuguese,
he met with a Dutch Fast Indiaman of 28
guns, whose captain was killed the first broadside,
and took her with little resistance, for he had hoisted
the pirate’s colours on board Spelt’s ship.</p>

<p class='c000'>He now, with three sail, steered for the island
of Ferdinando, where he hove down and cleaned
the Flying Dragon. Having careened, he put 11
Dutchmen on board Capt. Spelt, to make amends
for the hands he had forced from him, and sent him
away, making him a present of the goods he took
from the Portuguese ship. When he sailed himself,
he ordered the Dutch to stay at Ferdinando
24 hours after his departure; threatening, if he did
not comply, to sink his ship, if he fell a second time
into his hands, and to put all the company to the
sword. He then stood for the coast of Brazil,
where he met a Portuguese man of war of 70 guns,
which he came up with. The Portuguese hailed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>him, and he answered, <em>from London, bound to Buenos
Ayres</em>. The Portuguese manned his shrouds and
cheered him, when Condent fired a broadside and
a volley of small arms, which began a smart engagement
for the space of three glasses; but Condent
finding himself over-matched, made the best
of his way, and being the best sailer, got off.</p>

<p class='c000'>A few days after, he took a vessel of the same
nation, who gave an account, that he had killed
above 40 men in the guarda del Costa, beside a
number wounded. He kept along the coast to the
southward, and took a French ship of 18 guns, laden
with wine and brandy, bound for the South Sea,
which he carried with him into the River of Plate.
He sent some of his men ashore to kill some wild
cattle, but they were taken by the crew of a Spanish
man of war. On their examination before the
captain, they said they were two Guinea ships, with
slaves belonging to the South Sea company, and
on this story were allowed to return to their boats.
Here five of his forced men ran away, with his canoe;
he plundered the French ship, cut her adrift,
and she was stranded. He proceeded along the
Brazil coast, and hearing a pirate ship was lost upon
it, and the pirates imprisoned, he used all the
Portuguese who fell into his hands, who were
many, very barbarously, cutting off their ears and
noses; and as his master was a papist, when they
took a priest, they made him say mass at the mainmast,
and would afterwards get on his back and ride
him about the decks, or else load and drive him
like a beast. He from this went to the Guinea
coast, and took Capt. Hill, in the Indian Queen.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Luengo Bay he saw two ships at anchor, one
a Dutchman of 44 guns, the other an English ship,
called the Fame, Capt. Bowen, commander. They
both cut and ran ashore; the Fame was lost, but
the Dutch ship the pirate got off and took with him.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>When he was at sea again, he discharged Captain
Hill, and stood away for the East-Indies. Near the
Cape he took an Ostend East-Indiaman, of which
Mr. Nash a noted merchant in London, was supercargo.
Soon after he took a Dutch East-Indiaman,
discharged the Ostender, and made for Madagascar.
At the Isle of St. Mary, he met with some of Capt.
Halsey’s crew, whom he took on board with other
stragglers, and shaped his course for the East-Indies,
and in the way, at the island of Johanna, took,
in company with two other pirates he met at St.
Mary’s, the Cassandra East-Indiaman, commanded
by Capt. James Macraigh. He continued his course
for the East-Indies, where he made a very great
booty; and returning, touched at the isle of Mascarenhas,
where he met with a Portuguese ship of 70
guns, with the viceroy of Goa on board. This ship
he made prize of, and hearing she had money on
board, they would allow of no ransom, but carried
her to the coast of Zanguebar, where was a Dutch
fortification, which they took and plundered, razed
the fort, and carried off several men voluntarily.
From hence they stood for St. Mary’s, where they
shared their booty, broke up their company, and
settled among the natives. Here a snow came from
Bristol, which they obliged to carry a petition to the
governor of Mascarenhas for a pardon, though they
paid the master very generously. The governor
returned answer he would take them into protection
if they would destroy their ships, which they
agreed to, and accordingly sunk the Flying Dragon
&amp;c. Condent and some others went to Mascarenhas,
where Condent married the governor’s sister-in-law,
and remained some time; but, as I have
been credibly informed, he is since come to France,
settled at St. Maloes, and drives a considerable
trade as a merchant.</p>

  <h3 id='BELLAMY' class='c007'>CAPTAIN BELLAMY.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>As we cannot, with any certainty, deduce this
man from his origin, we shall begin where we find
him first a declared enemy to mankind. Capt. Bellamy
and Paul Williams, in two sloops, had been
upon a Spanish wreck, and not finding their expectation
answered, they resolved not to lose their
labour, and agreed to <em>go upon the account</em>, a term
among the pirates, which speaks their profession.
The first who had the misfortune to fall in their
way, was Capt. Prince, bound from Jamaica to London,
in a galley built at that port, whose cargo consisted
of elephant’s teeth, gold dust, and other rich
merchandise. This prize not only enriched but
strengthened them. They immediately mounted
this galley with 28 guns, and put on board 150 hands,
of different nations; Bellamy was declared captain,
and the vessel had her old name continued, which
was Whidaw. This happened about the latter end
of February, 1717. They, now thus fitted for continuing
their desperate resolution, shaped their
course for Virginia, which coast they very much
infested, taking several vessels. They were upon
shifting this station, when they were very near, as
the psalmist expresses it, <em>going quick down into hell</em>;
for the heavens beginning to lower, prognosticated
a storm. At the first appearance of the sky being
likely to be overcast, Bellamy took in all his small
sails, and Williams doubled-reefed his mainsail,
which was hardly done when a thunder shower
overtook them with such violence, that the Whidaw
was very near oversetting. They immediately put
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>before the wind, for they had no other way of
working, having only the goose wings of the fore-sail
to scud with. Happy for them the wind was at
W. by N. for had it been easterly, they must have
infallibly perished upon the coast. The storm increased
towards night, and not only put them by
all sail, but obliged the Whidaw to bring her yards
aportland, and all they could do with tackles to
the goose neck of the tiller, four men in the gun-room,
and two at the wheel, was to keep her head
to the sea, for had she once broached to, they
must infallibly have foundered. The heavens, in
the mean while, were covered with sheets of lightning,
which the sea, by the agitation of the saline
particles, seemed to imitate. The darkness of the
night was such, as the scripture says, <em>as might be
felt</em>; the terrible hollow roaring of the winds, could
be only equalled by the repeated, I may say, incessant
claps of thunder, sufficient to strike a dread
of the Supreme Being, who commands the sea
and the winds, one would imagine in every heart;
but among these wretches, the effect was different,
for they endeavoured by their blasphemies, oaths,
and horrid imprecations, to drown the uproar of
jarring elements. Bellamy swore he was sorry he
could not run out his guns to return the salute,
meaning the thunder, that he fancied the gods had
got drunk over their tipple, and were gone together
by the ears. They continued scudding all that
night under their bare poles: the next morning the
mainmast being sprung in the step, they were forced
to cut it away, and at the same time, the mizen came
by the board. These misfortunes made the ship
ring with blasphemy, which was increased, when,
by trying the pumps, they found the ship made a
great deal of water; though by continually plying
them, they kept it from gaining. The sloop, as well
as the ship, was left to the mercy of the winds,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>though the former, not having a tant mast, did not
lose it. The wind shifting round the compass,
made so outrageous and short a sea, that they had
little hopes of safety; it broke upon the poop,
drove in the taffarel, and washed the two men away
from the wheel, who were saved in the netting.
The wind after four days and three nights, abated
its fury, and fixed in the N. N. E. point, hourly decreasing,
and the weather clearing up they spoke
to the sloop, and resolved for the coast of Carolina.
They continued this course but a day and a night,
when the wind coming about to the southward, they
changed their resolution to that of going to Rhode
Island. All this while the Whidaw’s leak continued,
and it was as much as the lee pump could do to
keep the water from gaining, though it was kept
continually going. Jury-masts were set up, and
the carpenter finding the leak to be in the bows,
occasioned by the oakum working out of a seam,
the crew became very jovial again. The sloop
received no other damage than the loss of the mainsail,
which the first flurry tore away from the boom.
In their cruise off Rhode-Island, the beginning of
April, they took a sloop commanded by Capt. Beer,
belonging to Boston, in the lat. of South-Carolina,
40 leagues from land. They put the said captain
on board the Whidaw, while they rifled and plundered
his vessel, which Williams and Bellamy proposed
returning to him, but the crews being averse
to it, they sunk her, and put the captain ashore
upon Block Island.</p>

<p class='c000'>I cannot pass by in silence, Capt. Bellamy’s
speech to Capt. Beer. <em>I am sorry they won’t let
you have your sloop again, for I scorn to do any one
a mischief when it is not for my advantage; —— the
sloop, we must sink her, and she might be of use to
you. Though you are a sneaking puppy, and so
are all those who will submit to be governed by laws
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>which rich men have made for their own security,
for the cowardly whelps have not the courage otherwise
to defend what they get by their knavery; but
—— ye altogether: —— them for a pack of crafty
rascals, and you, who serve them, for a parcel of
hen-hearted numskulls. They vilify us, the scoundrels
do, when there is only this difference, they rob
the poor under the cover of law, forsooth, and we
plunder the rich under the protection of our own courage.
Had you not better make one of us, than sneak
after these villains for employment?</em> Captain Beer
told him, that his conscience would not allow
him to break through the laws of God and man.
<em>You are a devilish conscience rascal</em>, replied Bellamy;
<em>I am a free prince, and I have as much authority
to make war on the whole world, as he who has a
hundred sail of ships at sea, and an army of 100,000
men in the field; and this my conscience tells me: but
there is no arguing with such snivelling puppies, who
allow superiors to kick them about deck at pleasure</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The pirates, wanting neither provisions nor water,
and the Whidaw’s damage being repaired,
passed the time very jovially.</p>

<p class='c000'>A fortnight after setting Capt. Beer ashore, Williams
boarded and took a vessel off Cape Cod,
laden with wine; the crew of which increased the
number of their prisoners. They put seven men
on board the prize, with orders to keep company
with the ship and sloop, and left on board her the
master.</p>

<p class='c000'>As they had been long off the careen, they stood
away to the northward, and made the best of their
way to Penobscot river. When they were at the
mouth of it, it was thought more eligible to careen
in the river Mechisses. They entered it as agreed
and run up about two miles and a half, where they
came to an anchor with their prizes. The next
morning all the prisoners were set ashore with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>drivers, and orders to assist in building huts; the
guns were also set ashore, and a breast work raised,
with embrasures for the cannon on each side of the
river. This took up four days. A magazine was
dug deep in the earth, and a roof raised over it by
the poor slaves, the prisoners, whom they treated
after the same manner as the negroes are used by
the West-India planters. The powder being secured,
and every thing out, they hove down the sloop,
cleaned her, and when she had all in again, they
careened the Whidaw by the largest prize.</p>

<p class='c000'>They now thought of cruising again, and accordingly
steered for Fortune’s Bay in Newfoundland.
They made some prizes on the Banks, forced all
the men, and sunk the vessels.</p>

<p class='c000'>They had not been long on this coast before they
were separated by a storm, which held some days.
Off the island of St. Paul the Whidaw spied a sail,
which she immediately gave chase to. The ship
brought to and lay by for her, and proved a Frenchman
of 36 guns, carrying soldiers to Quebec. The
Whidaw engaged with great resolution, and the
French did not show less, for he boarded the Whidaw
and was twice put off, with the loss of men on
both sides. Bellamy, after two hour’s engagement,
thought the Frenchman too hard a match, and was
for shaking him off; but his enemy was not as willing
to part with him, for he gave chase, and as he
sailed altogether as well as Bellamy, the latter had
certainly been taken, and had received the due
punishment of his crimes, had not the night coming
on favoured his escape. He lost in this engagement
36 hands, besides several wounded.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Whidaw returned to the coast of Newfoundland,
and off Placentia Bay met with his consort and
the prize. They resolved to visit again the coast
of New-England, the Whidaw being much shattered
in the late engagement, having received a great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>many shot in her hull. They ran down this coast,
and between St. George’s Banks and Nantucket
Shools, took the Mary Anne.</p>

<p class='c000'>The master of the vessel, taken formerly off
Cape Cod, was left on board her, and as he was
very well acquainted with the coast, they ordered
him to carry the light and go ahead; and the
pirates commonly kept him at the helm. He upon
a night of public rejoicing, seeing all the pirates
drunk, laid hold of the opportunity, and run his
vessel ashore about midnight, near the land of
Eastham, out of which he alone escaped with life.
The Whidaw, steering after the light, met with the
same fate. The small vessel ran into a sandy bay,
and the men got ashore without difficulty.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the Whidaw struck, the pirates murdered
all their prisoners, that is, all their forced men; as
it is concluded, from the mangled carcasses which
were washed ashore; but not a soul escaped out
of her or Williams, who was also lost.</p>

<p class='c000'>The pirates, to the number of seven, who escaped,
were seized by the inhabitants, and on the information
of the master who escaped, and on their
own confession were imprisoned, condemned, and
executed. They were all foreigners, very ignorant
and obstinate; but by the indefatigable pains
of a pious and learned divine, who constantly attended
them; they were at length, by the special grace
of God, made sensible of, and truly penitent, for
the enormous crimes they had been guilty of.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>
  <h3 id='FLY' class='c007'>CAPTAIN WILLIAM FLY.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>As to the birth of this pirate, we can discover
nothing by the inquiries we have hitherto made;
and indeed had we succeeded in our search, it
would have been of no great consequence; for it is
certain by the behaviour of the man, he must have
have been of very obscure parents; and by his education,
(as he was no artist) very unfit in all respects,
except that of cruelty, for the villaneous business
he was in. We have been informed, that he had
been in a pirate in a private capacity, and having
escaped justice, had an opportunity of repenting
his former crimes, and as a foremast man, or petty
officer, of getting his bread in a warrantable way.
But no—ignorant as he was of letters, he was ambitious
of power, and capable of the most barbarous
actions to acquire it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Capt. Green, of Bristol, in April, 1726, shipped
this Fly as boatswain, at Jamaica, being bound, in
the Elizabeth snow, of Bristol, for the coast of Guinea.
Fly, who had insinuated himself with some
of the men, whom he found ripe for any villany,
resolved to seize the said snow, and murder the
captain and mate, and taking the command on himself,
turn pirate. He proposed this design to his
brothers in iniquity, who approving it, he, having
the watch at one o’clock in the morning, on the 27th
day of May, went up to one Morrice Cundon, then
at the helm, accompanied by Alexander Mitchel,
Henry Hill, Samuel Cole, Thomas Winthrop, and
other conspirators, and swore if he spoke one word,
or stirred either hand or foot, he would blow his
brains out; and tucking up his shirt above the elbows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>with a cutlass in his hand, he, with Mitchel, went
into the captain’s cabin, and told him he must turn
out. The captain, asking what was the matter, was
answered by Mitchel, they had no time to answer
impertinent questions; that if he would turn out
and go upon deck quietly, it would save them the
trouble of scraping the cabin; if he would not, a few
buckets of water and a scraper would take his blood
out of the deck: that they had chosen Capt. Fly for
commander, and would allow of no other, and would
not waste their provisions to feed useless men.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Captain replied, that since they had so resolved,
he should make no resistance; but begged
they would not murder him, since his living could
be no obstacle to their designs; that he had never
been harsh to either of them, and therefore they
could not kill him out of revenge; and if it was
only for their security, he desired, if they would not
take his word to do nothing to obstruct the measures
they had resolved on, they would secure him
in irons, till he might be put somewhere on shore,
<em>Ah</em>, says Fly, <em>to live and hang us, if we are ever
taken: no, no, walk up, that bite won’t take; it has
hanged many an honest fellow already</em>. Mitchel and
Fly then laying hold of him, pulled him out of his
bed. The poor captain entreating them to spare
his life for his soul’s sake, told them he would bind
himself down by the most solemn oaths, never to
appear against them; that he was unfit to appear
before the judgment seat of a just and pure God;
that he was loaded with sins, and to take him off
before he had washed those stains, which sullied
his soul, by the tears of repentance, would be a
cruelty beyond comparison greater than that of
depriving him of life, were he prepared for death,
since it would be, without any offence committed
against them, dooming him to eternal misery.
However, if they would not be persuaded that his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>life was consistent with their safety, he begged they
would allow some time to prepare himself for the
great change: that he begged no other mercy than
what the justice and compassion of the laws would
allow them, should they hereafter be taken. ——
<em>your blood</em>, said Mitchel, <em>no preaching. Be ——
a’ you will, what’s that to us? Let him look out who
has the watch. Upon deck you dog, for we shall lose
no more time about you.</em></p>

<p class='c000'>They hauled him into the steerage, and forced
him upon deck, where one of the hell-hounds asked
if he had rather take a leap like a brave fellow, or
be tossed over like a sneaking rascal? The captain
addressing himself to Fly, said, <em>Boatswain, for
God’s sake don’t throw me overboard; if you do I
am for ever lost; Hell’s the portion of my crimes.
—— him</em>, answered Fly, <em>since he’s so Godly, we’ll
give him time to say his prayers, and I’ll be parson.
Say after me.</em> Lord have mercy on me. <em>Short prayers
are best, so no more words and over with him,
my lads.</em> The captain still cried for mercy, and
begged an hour’s respite only, but all in vain; he
was seized by the villains and thrown overboard.
He caught, however, and hung by the main sheet,
which Winthrop seeing, fetched the cooper’s broad
axe, and chopping off the unhappy master’s hand,
he was swallowed up by the sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>The captain being thus dispatched, Thomas
Jenkins, the mate, was secured and brought upon
deck, to share the same cruel fate. His entreaties
were as useless as the captain’s; the sentence they
had passed upon him was not to be reversed; they
were deaf to his prayers and remonstrances, strangers
to humanity and compassion. He was of the
captain’s mess, they said, and they should e’en drink
together; it was a pity to part good company.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus they jested with his agonies. He, however,
made some struggle, which irritating his murderers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>one of them snatched up the axe, with which Winthrop
had lopped off the captain’s hand, and gave
him a great cut on the shoulder, by missing his head,
where the blow was aimed, and he was thrown into
the sea. He swam notwithstanding, and called out
to the doctor to throw him a rope, who, poor man,
could not hear him, being secured, and laid in irons
in his own cabin; and had he heard, and been able
to have thrown the rope required, could it be expected
that these hardened wretches would have
relented, and shown him mercy? But the sinking
man will catch at a straw, and hope, they say, is the
last that deserts us. While we have life we are apt
to flatter ourselves some lucky accident may favour
us.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was next debated what should be done with the
doctor. Some were for sending him to look after
the captain and mate; but the majority, as he was
a useful man, thought it better to keep him. All
obstacles being removed, Mitchel saluted Fly captain,
and with the rest of the crew who had been
in the conspiracy, with some ceremony, gave him
possession of the great cabin.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here a bowl of punch being made, Morrice Cundon
was called down, and one John Fitzherbert, set
to the helm in his place. At the same time the carpenter
and Thomas Streaton were brought before
the captain, who told them they were three rascals,
and richly deserved to be sent after the captain and
mate, but that they were willing to show them
mercy, and not put them to death in cold blood and
he would therefore only put them in irons, for the
security of the ship’s crew. They were accordingly
ordered out, and ironed. Fly then told his comrades
it was convenient to resolve on some course,
when word was brought them, that a ship was very
near them. The council broke up, and made a
clear ship, when in a very little while after, they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>found it was the Pompey, which had left Jamaica
in company with the snow. The Pompey, standing
for the snow which did not make from her, soon
hailed and asked how Capt. Green did, and was
answered by Fly, that he was very well. They did
not think fit to attack this ship, but returned to
hold their consultation; it was resolved to steer
for North-Carolina.</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon their arrival on that coast they spied a
sloop at anchor within the bar. She was called the
John and Hannah, and commanded by Capt. Fulker
who thinking the snow might want a pilot, stepped
into his boat with his mate, Mr. Atkinson, and Mr.
Roan, two passengers, and a young lad, in order to
bring her in. When they came on board, they were
told, that the snow was from Jamaica, with a cargo.
Capt. Fulker and Mr. Roan were desired to walk
down to the captain, who was in the cabin. Fly received
them very civilly, ordered a bowl of punch,
and hearing Capt. Fulker had brought another passenger
on board Mr. Atkinson was also invited down.</p>

<p class='c000'>The punch being brought in, Capt. Fly told his
guest, <em>that he was no man to mince matters; that he
and his comrades were gentlemen of fortune, and
should make bold to try if Capt. Fulker’s sloop was
a better sailer than the snow. If she was, she would
prove much fitter for their business, and they must
have her.</em> The snow came to an anchor about a
league off the sloop, and Fly ordered Fulker, with
six of his own hands, into the boat to bring her along
side of the snow; but the wind proving contrary,
their endeavours proved also vain, and they returned
again in the boat, bringing Capt. Fulker back
with them. As soon as they got on board the snow,
Fly fell into a violent passion, cursing and abusing
Fulker for not bringing off the sloop. He gave him
his reason, and said it was impossible. <em>You lie you
dog</em>, replied the pirate, <em>but your hide shall pay for your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>roguery, and if I can’t bring her off, I’ll burn her
where she lies.</em> He then ordered Capt. Fulker to the
geers; no reason, no arguments could prevail; he
was stripped and lashed after a very inhuman manner;
and the boat’s crew being sent again, with
much ado carried her off as far as the bar, where
she bilged and sunk. The pirates then endeavoured
to set what remained of her out of water on
fire, but they could not burn her.</p>

<p class='c000'>The snow getting under sail to look-out for some
booty, Fulker and the others desired they might be
set at liberty, but it was denied them for the present,
though not without a promise that they should
be released the first vessel they took. On the 5th
of June they left Carolina, and the next day spied
a sail, which proved the John and Betty, commanded
by Capt. Gale, bound from Barbadoes to Guinea.
Fly gave chase, but finding the ship wronged him,
he made a signal of distress, hoisting his jack at the
main-top-mast head; but this decoy did not hinder
the ship making the best of her way. Fly continued
the chase all night, and the wind slackening, he
came within shot of the ship, and fired several guns
at her under his black ensign. The ship being of no
force, and the pirates ready to board, the captain
struck; and Fly, manning his long-boat, the crew
being well armed with pistols and cutlasses, went
on board the prize, and sent Capt. Gale, after having
secured his men, prisoner on board the snow.
This prize was of little value to the pirates, who
took nothing but some sail-cloth and small arms,
and after two days let her go, but took away six
of his men, setting on board Capt. Fulker, a passenger,
and Capt. Green’s surgeon. They kept
Mr. Atkinson, knowing he was a good artist, and
lately master of the Boneta brigantine, as a pilot
for the coast of New-England, which they were
satisfied he was well acquainted with.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>Upon Mr. Atkinson’s desiring to have his liberty
with the others, Capt. Fly refused it with the most
horrid oaths and imprecations, and insisted upon it
that he should act as their pilot; assuring him at the
same time, if he piloted them wrong, his life should
be the forfeit.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Atkinson answered, it was very hard he
should be forced to take upon himself the pilotage,
when he did not pretend to know the coast, and
that his life should answer for any mistake his ignorance
of it might make him guilty of, and therefore
begged he might be set on board Capt. Gale; and
that they would trust their own knowledge, since
he did not doubt there being better artist on board.
<em>No no</em>, replied Fly, <em>that won’t do—your palavering
won’t save your bacon; so either discharge your trust
like an honest man, (for go you shan’t) or I’ll send
you with my service to the d—l: so no more words
about the matter.</em></p>

<p class='c000'>There was no reply made, and they stood for the
coast of New-England. Off Delaware Bay they
made a sloop, commanded by one Harris, bound
from New-York to Pennsylvania. She had on board
about fifty passengers. Fly gave chase, and coming
up with her, hoisted his black ensign, and ordered
her to strike, which she immediately did; and Fly
sent Capt. Atkinson on board, to sail her, though
he would not allow him (Atkinson) any arms. The
pirates ransacked this prize, but not finding her of
any use to them, after a detention of 24 hours, they
let her go, with her men, excepting only a well
made young fellow, whose name was James Benbrooke,
whom they kept.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fly, after having released the prize, ordered Capt.
Atkinson to carry the snow into Martha’s Vineyard,
but he wilfully missed this place. Fly, finding himself
beyond Nantucket, and that his design was
balked, called to Atkinson, and told him <em>he was a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>rascally scoundrel and that it was a piece of cruelty
to let such a villain live, who designed the death of
so many honest fellows</em>. Atkinson, in his defence,
said, he never pretended to know the coast, and
that it was very hard he should die for being thought
an abler man than he really was. Had he pretended
to be their pilot, and did not know his business,
he deserved punishment; but when he was forced
upon a business which he before declared he did
not understand, it would be certainly cruel to make
him suffer for their mistake. <em>You are an obstinate
villain</em>, replied Fly, <em>and your design is to hang us; but
blood and wounds, you dog, you shan’t live to see it</em>—and
saying this, he ran into his cabin and brought
a pistol, with design to shoot Atkinson; but by the
interposition of Mitchel, who thought him innocent
of any design, he escaped.</p>

<p class='c000'>Atkinson, who perceived his life every minute
in danger, began to ingratiate himself with the pirates
and gave them hopes, that with good and gentle
usage, he might be brought to join them. This
he did not say in express terms, but by words he
now and then let drop, as by accident. They were
not a little rejoiced at the idea of having so good
an<a id='t140'></a> artist to join them; nay some of them hinted to him,
that if he would take upon him the command, they
were ready to dispossess Capt. Fly, who carried
his command too high, and was known to all the
crew to be no artist, and to understand nothing beyond
the business of a boatswain. Atkinson thought
it his interest to keep them in the opinion that he
would join; but always declined hearing any thing
as to the command.</p>

<p class='c000'>This made him less severely used, and protected
him from the insults of Fly, who imagined he would
betray them the first opportunity, therefore, more
than once proposed his being thrown overboard,
which was never approved by the snow’s company.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>From Nantucket they stood to the eastward, and
off Brown’s Bank made a fishing schooner. Fly,
coming up with her, fired a gun, and hoisting his
black ensign, swore, <em>if they did not instantly bring
to, and send their boat on board, he would sink her</em>.
The schooner obeyed, and sent away her boat on
board the snow. He examined the captain as to
what vessels were to be met with, and promised, if
he could put him in the way of meeting with a good
sailer, to let him go, and give him his vessel, or he
should otherwise keep her. The poor man told him
he had a companion which would soon be in sight,
and was a much better vessel. Accordingly about
12 at noon, the same day, which was the 23d of
June, the other schooner hove in sight; upon
which Fly manned this prize with six pirates and
a prisoner named George Tasker, and sent her in
chase, having himself on board the snow, no more
than three pirates, Capt. Atkinson, (who had worked
himself into some favour with him) and fifteen
forced men; but he took care to have his arms
upon deck by him.</p>

<p class='c000'>The men who had not taken on with Fly, were
Atkinson, Capt. Fulker’s mate, and two youths belonging
to him; the carpenter and gunner belonging
to Capt. Green; six of Capt. Gale’s men, and
the aforesaid Benbrooke, who belonged to Capt.
Harris, with three of the men out of the schooner.
Atkinson, seeing the prisoners and forced men were
five to one of the pirates, thought of delivering himself
from the bondage he was in: and as by good
luck several other fishing vessels hove in sight, right
ahead of the snow, he called to Capt. Fly, and told
him he spied several other vessels ahead, desiring
he would come forward and bring his glass. Fly
did so, and leaving his arms on the quarter deck,
set on the windlass to see if he could make out what
they were. Atkinson, who had concerted his measures
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>with one Walker and the above mentioned
Benbrooke, secured the arms on the quarter deck,
and gave them a signal to seize Fly; which they
did, with very little trouble, and afterwards made
themselves masters of the other three pirates and
the snow, the rest of the prisoners, not knowing
any thing of, or what the design might be, remaining
altogether inactive, and brought the snow and
pirates to Great Brewster, where a guard was put
on board, June 28, 1726.</p>

<p class='c000'>Soon after, the said pirates were brought to their
trial, that is, on the 4th of July following, before
the Honourable William Dummer, Esq., Lieutenant
Governor and commander in chief of the province
of Massachusetts Bay, President of the Special
Court of Admiralty, at the court-house of Boston,
assisted by 18 gentlemen of the council; before
whom they were found guilty of murder and piracy
condemned to be executed, and accordingly
were executed the 12th of July. Fly was ordered
to be hanged in chains at the entrance of the harbour
of Boston. Thus ended the short reign of an
obdurate wretch, who only wanted skill and power
to be as infamous as any who scoured the seas.
The names of the three pirates, executed with
him, were, Samuel Cole, George Condick, and
Henry Greenvil.</p>

<p class='c008'>We have said, in another life, viz. White’s that
he was a lighterman on the river Thames. His father
was of that business, and had the character of
a very honest man. After his father’s decease, he
grew very extravagant, and squandered away not
only what he had left his son, but what he had allotted
for his widow, whose indulgence, putting
every thing into her son’s hands, was followed by
being herself turned out of doors, for he sold the
house over her head. After having ruined himself
and mother, his friends fearing the wickedness of
his inclination would bring scandal upon them,
persuaded him to go to sea, and procured him a
voyage to Jamaica, on board a merchant ship. At
this island he ran away from his ship, and associating
himself with some desperate fellows, they stole
a canoe, and went away to the Grand Camanas, to
join some others of their own stamp, who lurked
thereabouts, with design <em>to go on the account</em>, the
term for pirating. They met those they looked
for, made up a company of 20 men, surprised and
made themselves masters of a turtling sloop, and
set out in search of booty.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first prizes they made were only turtlers,
which, however, increased the number of their
crew, some being willing to join them, others being
forced, with threats of being set on shore, on some
desolate key. After some time cruising, they met
with an Irish brigantine, which had provisions and
servants on board. They made an exchange with
the master, gave him provision to carry him to Jamaica,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>and allowed five hands to go with him.
The rest (except the servants, who readily took on
with the pirates) were all forced. Not long after,
they surprised a sloop which had been trading on
the Spanish coast. As she had 6 guns, and was a
fit vessel for their turn, they changed her against
the brigantine. Several hands belonging to this
sloop entered volunteers, and several more were
obliged to join them by compulsion. After this
capture, they steered for the coast of Virginia, and
in their way, met with a large New-England brigantine,
laden with provisions bound for Barbadoes.
This they made prize of, and shifting their own
guns on board her, sent the master away with the
sloop, after forcing some of his men with them.
They had now a vessel of ten guns, and a crew of
80 men, of whom one James was captain, and Howard
quarter-master.</p>

<p class='c000'>While they lay on the coast of Virginia, they
made prize of several ships from England, out of
which they took men, liquors, provisions, clothes
and whatever else they liked or thought necessary.
As these ships had several felons on board, who
were transports, they had out of them a number of
volunteers, besides forced men; so that they had
a large complement. Among other Virginia ships
which fell into their hands, they made prize, with
little trouble, of a fine galley, mounted with 24
guns, which afforded them a great many volunteers,
as she had a number of transported malefactors
and servants on board. They changed their brigantine
for this ship, and soon after, the man of war,
which waited on this coast, heaving in sight, they
thought proper to take their departure.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the coast of Virginia, they shaped their
course for that of Guinea, where they took a great
many ships of different nations, all which they rifled
of what they thought fit. Out of these ships they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>forced on board a number of men, equal to the
number of those formerly compelled, who desired,
and whom they permitted, to be discharged, after
much entreaty.</p>

<p class='c000'>After they had been some months on the coast,
they spied a large three decked Portuguese ship,
from Brazil, mounted with 36 guns. They gave
chase and came up with her. The captain would
make no resistance; but his mate, who was an Englishman,
named Rutland, thinking it a shame to
give up such a ship, resolved to defend her; which
the Portuguese captain consented to, but went himself
out of harm’s way. Rutland, who had been
master of an English brigantine, taken from him on
the same coast by another gang of pirates, fought
them the better part of a forenoon; but the Portuguese
flying the decks, and only 30 men, who were
English, Dutch, and French, standing by him, he
was obliged to ask quarters, which were given.
When the pirates came on board, they asked Rutland
if he was commander? He answered, no.
They inquired after him, and being told he was
somewhere in the hold, they searched, and found
him hid in the powder room; whence they hauled
him up, and whipped him round the deck for his
cowardice. Rutland, and those who fought the
ship, were forced on board, and their complement
being now 180 men, they exchanged their galley
for the Portuguese ship, carried her in shore, and
ripping off her upper deck, made her deep waisted,
by cutting down some of her gunnel. This prize
they named the Alexander.</p>

<p class='c000'>They went down the coast in this ship, and made
several prizes, some of which they discharged, and
put on board such of their forced men as begged
their discharge; others they sunk, and burnt others;
but forced on board carpenters, caulkers, armourers,
surgeons, and musicians. In their way to Cape
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>Lopez, where they designed, and afterwards did
clean, they found a large Bristol ship at an anchor,
which had lost a great many men by sickness, and
had then but few healthy on board, who got into the
boat, and endeavoured to get on shore, but were
prevented by the pirates. Here they changed some
more of their forced men, and did intend to change
their ship; but on a survey, found the Bristol ship
too old for their purpose, and therefore left her at
an anchor, after they had taken what they thought
of use to them. This ship belonged to one Mr.
Godly, of Bristol.</p>

<p class='c000'>They met with nothing else in their way to Cape
Lopez, where they cleaned their ship, took in wood
and water, and then stood away to sea again. At
their leaving Cape Lopez, they spied an English
ship, which they came up with and engaged. The
merchantman made an obstinate defence, and finding
the design to board, made to close quarters.
Howard, and seven or eight more, entered; but
the pirate’s boatswain not having secured his lashing,
they fell astern, and left these men on board
the merchant ship, who seeing themselves in danger,
hauled up the boat, which the chase had
astern, and cutting the rope, got on board the
Alexander, which being considerably the larger
ship, and drawing a great deal more water, struck
on an unknown bank, which the merchantman
went over, and by this lucky accident escaped.</p>

<p class='c000'>This obliged the pirates to start their water, and
throw over the wood to get the ship off, which put
them under a necessity of going back to Cape Lopez
to take in those necessaries. After having a
second time wooded and watered, they put again
to sea, fell in with and took two Portuguese brigantines,
which they burnt, and setting the men on
shore, they made for, and doubled the Cape of
Good Hope, and shaped their course for Madagascar,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>where to the northward of, and near a small
island, they run the ship on a reef, where she stuck
fast. The captain being then sick in his bed, the
men went ashore on the small adjacent island, and
carried off a great deal of provisions and water to
lighten the ship, on board of which none but the
captain, the quarter-master, and about eleven more
were left.</p>

<p class='c000'>The quarter-master, who was Howard, with the
others, took all the treasure, put it on board the
boats, and made off for the main of Madagascar.
The captain, hearing nobody stir upon deck, made
shift to crawl out of his cabin, and seeing them put
off, fired the two fore chase guns at them, which
alarmed (to no purpose) the men ashore. As the
sea ebbed, the ship lay dry, and they could walk to
her from the island. She might have been saved
had they the boats to carry out an anchor; but for
want of them they brought every thing ashore, at
tide of flood, upon rafts. As the ship lay in a quiet
place, they had opportunity to rip her up, and
build a vessel out of her wreck. The major part of
the crew being English and Dutch who sided
together, they forced about 36 Portuguese and
French (thinking their crew too numerous for their
provisions in the present circumstances) to get upon
a raft, and take their chance with the sea-breeze
to get to the island of Madagascar, about three
leagues from them. They finished a vessel of 60
tons, but the day they designed to have launched
her, a pirate brigantine hove in sight, who took
them on board.</p>

<p class='c000'>Howard and his consorts stood along the W. side
of the island, with design to round the N. end, and
to go to St. Mary’s but finding the current too
strong to stem, they lay there about a fortnight.
In the interim they spied three sail of tall ships,
which were men of war under Commodore Littleton,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>viz. the Anglesa, Hastings, and Lizard, who
had carried a pardon to the island of St. Mary’s,
accepted of by many of the pirates. Thinking these
might be also pirates, they made a smoke, which
brought the boats ashore; but finding they were
men of war’s boats, the pirates thought fit to abscond;
wherefore, finding nothing nor any body,
the said men of war’s boats returned, and the ships
kept their cruise.</p>

<p class='c000'>They had here plenty of fish and wild hogs which
they found in the woods. One day, when Howard
was hunting, his comrades took the opportunity,
went off, rounded the north end, and left Mr. Howard
to provide for himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>About four or five-and-twenty leagues from the
Cape, they went into a fine harbour on the east side,
not frequented, nay, hardly known to the European
ships. They were here received handsomely,
treated and provided with fresh meat, and what
necessaries they wanted, by the king of this district,
whose name was Mushmango, who had formerly
been driven from Augustin by war, and travelling
through the heart of the country, had here fixed
his settlement. When the boats were victualled,
and while Johnson, who took on him the command
after they had deserted Howard, was ashore with
three more, the rest went off with the boats and
booty, and stood away to the southward, along the
coast, designing for St. Mary’s, going every night
into some harbour, or coming to an anchor under
some point when the winds proved contrary.</p>

<p class='c000'>Johnson addressed himself to the king, and told
him the boat and goods were his property; upon
which he went along shore with a number of
men, and found the boat at an anchor, and all asleep,
except one to look out, at whom the king fired his
blunderbuss, and killed him. The report of the
piece awakened the others, who cut and stood off
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>the coast. The king returned, gave Johnson an
account of his expedition, and furnished him a canoe,
some calabashes of fresh water, provisions,
and lances, that he might pursue after his people.
Johnson kept the shore on board till he came to the
island of St. Mary’s, where he heard his comrade
fugitives were gone to, and settled at Ambonavoula,
in a village belonging to the natives on the river of
Manansallang. Leaving his canoe, he went into
one belonging to an inhabitant, who carried him to
his companions.</p>

<p class='c000'>After he had been here some few months, Fourgette,
already mentioned in White’s life, came in
with his ship from Martinico. With this vessel they
sailed to the west side, and came to an anchor at an
island called Anquawla, 30 leagues from the place
where they left Howard.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some of the subjects of the king of Anquawla had
before met with, and brought hither, Capt. Howard,
who seeing the ship at anchor near shore, hailed
her, and desired the boat might be sent to fetch him
off, which was accordingly done, and he joined the
rest of the crew. Here two boys ran away from
them, whom they demanded of the king; but he
not delivering them, they went ashore by day-break,
surprised his town, and brought off twelve of his
concubines, whom they detained on board, till their
boys, who were blacks, were returned, and then delivered
them back. From this ship he went on
board the Speaker, where he continued till she was
lost on Mauritius, when he came back to Madagascar,
and settled at Augustin. Here he tarried till
the Prosperous, a ship of 36 guns, commanded by
Capt. Hilliard, came in, which Howard and some
other pirates (with the assistance of the boatswain
and some of the crew belonging to the ship,) seized.
In taking this ship, the captain and his chief mate
were killed, and several others wounded. Howard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>was by the company declared captain. Several of
the ships crew took on with them, and they went
round the south end to the east side, till they came
the length of Maritan, where they found some of
the Speaker’s company, whom they took on board,
and made up their complement about 70 men.</p>

<p class='c000'>From hence they steered for the island of St. Mary’s,
where they heeled their ship, watered, wooded,
and shipped some more hands. Here they had
an invitation from one Ort Van Tyle, who lived on
the main of Madagascar, to come to the ceremony
of christening two of his children. They were kindly
received and treated by him, but it having been
reported that this Ort Van Tyle had murdered some
pirates, they in revenge, though they had no certainty
of the fact, took him prisoner, plundered his
house, and what goods they could not take off in a
great canoe belonging to him, they threw into the
river or burnt. Ort Van Tyle they designed to carry
on board, and hang at the yard-arm; but one of the
pirates helped him to escape, and he took into the
woods, where meeting some of his blacks, he waylaid
his canoe and Howard’s pinnace by the river
side. Besides what goods they had on board of this
Dutchman’s they had several women and children
belonging to him and some white men, who had left
them under his care. The pirates set the women
to the paddles, and the canoe was overset on the
bar; Ort Van Tyle fired on the men, and shot one
through the arm and through the thigh, whom with
his comrade, he took prisoner, and kept with him.
The rest of the men got ashore on the south side
of the river and escaped him; the women on the
north side, and returned home. When the pinnace
came down, he fired and shot the captain through
the arm, but he got on board, where his arm was
set. After this, the Prosperous sailed for Methelage,
where they victualled, with a design to go to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>the East-Indies. While they lay here, came in a
large Dutch ship, well manned, and of 40 guns.
The Prosperous was not strong enough to attack
her, and the Dutch, fearing he should spoil his
trade, would not meddle with Howard, though
hard words passed, and the Dutchman threatened
to fall foul on him if he did not leave the place,
which Howard thought fit to do, and sailed to Mayotta.</p>

<p class='c000'>A few days after the departure of the Prosperous,
Capt. Bowen, in the Scotch ship, came in, anchored
within small arm shot, and right ahead of
the Dutchman, whom he saluted with 11 guns, shot
and all, which the other returned with 15, after the
same manner; drums beating and trumpets sounding
on both sides. The Dutchman, however, was
surprised, and under apprehensions. He hailed
the pirate, and answer was returned, <em>From the seas</em>.
He then bid them send their boat on board, which
accordingly went with the quarter-master, who told
the captain, that they had no design on him, but
were going against the Moors, and came in for
provision. He replied, they could get none there,
and the best way was to be gone; however, the
quarter-master went ashore, (where the Dutch had
made his factory, and had some goods) and shot
down three oxen, which he ordered the natives to
help to cut in pieces. The Dutchman, perceiving
a friendship between the natives and pirates, seeing
Bowen full of men, and hearing two more pirates
were expected, thought fit to go off in the night,
and leave the goods he had put on shore.</p>

<p class='c000'>A few days after, Bowen, seizing the goods left,
went for Mayotta, where he joined the Prosperous,
and lay for the season to go to the East-Indies.
After some stay here, their salt provision perishing,
they returned to Madagascar to revictual, Bowen to
St. Augustin, and Howard (on board of whose ship
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>was Capt. Whaley, taken as related in Bowen’s life)
to Methelage, agreeing to meet at the island of St.
Johns, to lie for the Moors fleet; where after some
disappointments, they met, and got sight of the
Moors fleet, one of which fell a prize to Bowen; but
the Prosperous being a heavy sailer, did not come
up with them till they were at an anchor at the bar
of Surat, where they waited to lighten. The Moors
seeing few hands on board, for Howard concealed
his men, and not imagining a pirate would venture
up, concluded him an English East-Indiaman.
Howard clapped the largest on board, which stood
him a smart engagement, and killed him about 30
men. At length the pirates forced Capt. Whaley
who spoke the Moors language to go on board and
offer quarter, which they excepted. There was on
board this prize a nobleman belonging to the Great
Mogul, who had been at Jaffa to buy horses for his
master. The prize yielded them a great booty,
though they found but part of the money which was
on board. They intended to carry her to Madagascar,
but her bowsprit being wounded in the boarding,
she lost all her masts; wherefore they sent her
adrift, and she ran ashore at Deman, belonging to
the Portuguese.</p>

<p class='c000'>From hence he steered to the Malabar coast,
where he met Bowen and his prize, which mounted
56 guns. Both crews went on board Bowen, sunk
the Prosperous, and burnt the Scotch ship, called
the Speedy Return. Hence they stood along the
coast of India; and Howard, with about 20 more,
landed with what they had, and retired among the
natives, where Howard married a women of the
country, and being a morose, ill-natured fellow and
using her ill, he was murdered by her relations.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>
  <h3 id='LEWIS' class='c007'>CAPTAIN LEWIS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>This worthy gentleman was an early pirate.
We first find him a boy on board the pirate Banister
who was hanged at the yard arm of a man of war
in sight of Port Royal, Jamaica. This Lewis and
another boy were taken with him, and brought into
the island hanging by the middle at the mizen peak.
He had a great aptitude for languages, and spoke
perfectly well that of the Mosquil Indians, French,
Spanish, and English. I mention our own, because
it is doubted whether he was French or English,
for we cannot trace him back to his origin.
He sailed out of Jamaica till he was a lusty lad,
and was then taken by the Spaniards at the Havana,
where he tarried some time; but at length he and
six more ran away with a small canoe, and surprised
a Spanish periagua, out of which two men joined
them, so that they were now nine in company.
With this periagua they surprised a turtling sloop,
and forced some of the hands to take on with them;
the others they sent away in the periagua.</p>

<p class='c000'>He played at this small game, surprising and
taking coasters and turtlers, till with forced men
and volunteers he made up a company of 40 men.
With these he took a large pink built ship, bound
from Jamaica to the bay of Campeachy, and after
her, several others bound to the same place; and
having intelligence that there lay in the bay a fine
Bermuda built brigantine of 10 guns, commanded
by Capt. Tucker, he sent the captain of the pink
to him with a letter, the purport of which was, that
he wanted such a brigantine, and if he would part
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>with her, he would pay him 10,000 pieces of eight;
if he refused this, he would take care to lie in his
way, for he was resolved, either by fair or foul
means to have the vessel. Capt. Tucker, having
read the letter, sent for the masters of vessels then
lying in the bay, and told them, after he had shown
the letter, that if they would make him up 54 men,
(for there were about 10 Bermuda sloops) he would
go out and fight the pirates. They said no, they
would not hazard their men, they depended on
their sailing, and every one must take care of himself
as well as he could.</p>

<p class='c000'>However, they all put to sea together, and spied
a sail under the land, which had a breeze while
they lay becalmed. Some said he was a turtler;
others, the pirate, and so it proved; for it was honest
Capt. Lewis, who putting out his oars, got in
among them. Some of the sloops had four guns,
some two, some none. Joseph Dill had two, which
he brought on one side, and fired smartly at the pirate,
but unfortunately one of them split, and killed
three men. Tucker called to all the sloops to send
him men, and he would fight Lewis, but to no purpose;
nobody came on board him. In the mean
while a breeze sprung up, and Tucker, trimming
his sails, left them, who all fell a prey to the pirate;
into whom, however, he fired a broadside at going
off. One sloop, whose master I will not name, was
a very good sailer, and was going off; but Lewis
firing a shot, brought her to, and he lay by till all
the sloops were visited and secured. Then Lewis
sent on board him, and ordered the master into his
sloop. As soon as he was on board, he asked the
reason of his lying by, and betraying the trust his
owners had reposed in him, which was doing like
a knave and coward, and he would punish him accordingly;
<em>for</em>, said he, <em>you might have got off, being
so much a better sailer than my vessel</em>. After this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>speech, he fell upon him with a rope’s end, and then
snatching up his cane, drove him about the decks
without mercy. The master, thinking to pacify
him, told him he had been out trading in that sloop
several months, and had on board a good quantity
of money, which was hid, and which, if he would
send on board a black belonging to the owners, he
would discover to him. This had not the desired
effect, but one quite contrary; for Lewis told him
he was a rascal and villain for this discovery, and
he would pay him for betraying his owners, and
redoubled his strokes. However, he sent and took
the money and negro, who was an able sailor. He
took out of his prizes what he had occasion for,
40 able negro sailors, and a white carpenter. The
largest sloop, which was about 90 tons, he took for
his own use, and mounted her with 12 guns. His
crew was now about 80 men, whites and blacks.</p>

<p>The Pirates Flogging the Captain of a Sloop. Page <a href='#Page_155'>155</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>After these captures, he cruised in the Gulf of
Florida, laying in wait for the West-India homeward
bound ships that took the leeward passage, several
of which, falling into his hands, were plundered
by him, and released. From hence he went to the
coast of Carolina, where he cleaned his sloop, and
a great many men whom he had forced, ran away
from him. However, the natives traded with him
for rum and sugar, and brought him all he wanted,
without the government’s having any knowledge
of him, for he had got into a very private creek;
though he was very much on his guard, that he
might not be surprised from the shore.</p>

<p class='c000'>From Carolina he cruised on the coast of Virginia,
where he took and plundered several merchantmen,
and forced several men, and then returned
to the coast of Carolina, where he did abundance
of mischief. As he had now an abundance
of French on board, who had entered with him, and
Lewis, hearing the English had a design to maroon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>them, he secured the men he suspected, and put
them in a boat, with all the other English, ten
leagues from shore, with only ten pieces of beef,
and sent them away, keeping none but French
and negroes. These men, it is supposed all perished
in the sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the coast of Carolina he shaped his course
for the banks of Newfoundland, where he overhauled
several fishing vessels, and then went into
Trinity Harbour in Conception Bay, where there
lay several merchantmen, and seized a 24 gun galley,
called the Herman. The commander, Capt.
Beal, told Lewis, if he would send his quarter-master
ashore he would furnish him with necessaries.
He being sent ashore, a council was held among
the masters, the consequence of which was, the
seizing the quarter-master, whom they carried to
Capt. Woodes Rogers. He chained him to a sheet
anchor which was ashore, and planted guns at the
point, to prevent the pirate getting out, but to little
purpose; for the people at one of these points
firing too soon, Lewis quitted the ship, and, by the
help of oars and the favour of the night, got out
in his sloop, though she received many shot in her
hull. The last shot that was fired at the pirate
did him considerable damage.</p>

<p class='c000'>He lay off and on the harbour, swearing he would
have his quarter-master, and intercepted two fishing
shallops, on board of one of which was the captain
of the galley’s brother. He detained them,
and sent word, if his quarter-master did not immediately
come off, he would put all his prisoners to
death. He was sent on board without hesitation.
Lewis and the crew inquired how he had been used,
and he answered, very civilly. “It’s well,” said the
pirate, “for had you been ill treated, I would have
put all these rascals to the sword.” They were
dismissed, and the captain’s brother going over the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>side, the quarter-master stopped him, saying, he
must drink the gentlemen’s health ashore, particularly
Capt. Rogers’, and, whispering him in the
ear, told him, if the crew had known of his being
chained all night, he would have been cut in pieces,
with all his men. After this poor man and his
shallop’s company were gone, the quarter-master
told the usage he had met with, which enraged
Lewis, and made him reproach his quarter-master,
whose answer was, that he did not think it just
the innocent should suffer for the guilty.</p>

<p class='c000'>The masters of the merchantmen sent to Capt.
Tudor Trevor, who lay at St. John’s in the Sheerness
man of war. He immediately got under sail,
and missed the pirate but four hours. She kept
along the coast and made several prizes, French
and English, and put into a harbour where a French
ship lay making fish. She was built at the latter
end of the war, for a privateer, was an excellent
sailer, and mounted 24 guns. The commander
hailed him: the pirate answered, <em>from Jamaica with
rum and sugar</em>. The Frenchman bid him go about
his business; that a pirate sloop was on the coast,
and he might be the rogue: if he did not immediately
sheer off, he would fire a broadside into him.
He went off and lay a fortnight out at sea, so far as
not to be descried from shore, with resolution to
have the ship. The Frenchman being on his guard,
in the mean while raised a battery on the shore,
which commanded the harbour. After a fortnight,
when he was thought to be gone off, he returned,
and took two of the fishing shallops belonging to
the Frenchman, and manning them with pirates,
they went in. One shallop attacked the battery,
the other surprised, boarded, and carried the ship,
just as the morning star appeared, for which reason
he gave her that name. In the engagement the
owner’s son was killed, who made the voyage out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>of curiosity only. The ship being taken, seven
guns were fired, which was the signal, and the sloop
came down and lay along side the ship. The captain
told him he supposed he only wanted his liquor;
but Lewis made answer, he wanted his ship,
and accordingly hoisted all his ammunition and
provision into her. When the Frenchman saw they
would have his ship, he told her trim, and Lewis
gave him the sloop; and excepting what he took
for provision, all the fish he had made. Several of
the French took on with him, who, with others,
English and French, had by force or voluntarily,
made him up 200 men.</p>

<p class='c000'>From Newfoundland he steered for the coast of
Guinea, where he took a great many ships, English,
Dutch, and Portuguese. Among these ships was
one belonging to Carolina, commanded by Capt.
Smith. While he was in chase of this vessel an
accident happened, which made his men believe he
dealt with the devil; for he carried away his fore
and main-top-mast; he, Lewis, running up the
shrouds to the main-top, tore off a handful of hair,
and throwing it into the air, used this expression,
<em>good devil, take this till I come</em>. And it was observed,
that he came afterwards faster up with the
chase than before the loss of his top-masts.</p>

<p class='c000'>Smith being taken, Lewis used him very civilly,
and gave him as much, or more in value than he
took from him, and let him go, saying, he would
come to Carolina when he had made money on
the coast, and would rely on his friendship.</p>

<p class='c000'>They kept some time on the coast, when they
quarrelled among themselves, the French and English,
of which the former was more numerous, and
they resolved to part. The French therefore chose
a large sloop newly taken, thinking the ship’s bottom,
which was not sheathed, damaged by the
worms. According to this agreement they took on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>board what ammunition and provision they thought
fit out of the ship, and put off, choosing one Le
Barre captain. As it blew hard, and the decks
were encumbered, they came to an anchor under the
coast, to stow away their ammunition, goods, &amp;c.
Lewis told his men they were a parcel of rogues,
and he would make them refund; accordingly run
along side, his guns being all loaded and new primed,
and ordered him to cut away his mast, or he
would sink him. Le Barre was obliged to obey.
Then he ordered them all ashore. They begged
the liberty of carrying their arms, goods, &amp;c. with
them, but he allowed them only their small arms
and cartridge-boxes. Then he brought the sloop
along side, put every thing on board the ship, and
sunk the sloop.</p>

<p class='c000'>Le Barre and the rest begged to be taken on
board. However, though he denied them, he suffered
Le Barre and some few to come, with whom
he and his men drank plentifully. The negroes
on board Lewis told him the French had a plot
against him. He answered, he could not withstand
his destiny; for the devil told him in the great cabin,
he should be murdered that night.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the dead of the night, the rest of the French
came on board in canoes, got into the cabin and
killed Lewis. They fell on the crew; but, after an
hour and a half’s dispute, the French were beat off,
and the quarter-master, John Cornelius, an Irishman,
succeeded Lewis.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>
  <h3 id='CORNELIUS' class='c007'>CAPTAIN JOHN CORNELIUS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Having now the command of the Morning Star,
Cornelius kept on the coast, and made several
prizes, both English and Portuguese. The former
he always discharged, after he had taken what he
thought fit, but the latter he commonly burnt.</p>

<p class='c000'>While he was thus ravaging the coast, two English
ships, which had slaved at Whidaw, one of 56
guns, and the other 12, which fought close, were
ready to sail; and having notice of a pirate, who
had done great mischief, resolved to keep company
together for their defence. The captain of
the small ship lay sick in his cabin, and she was left
to the care of the mates. When they had got under
sail, 200 negroes jumped overboard from the larger
ship, which obliged her to bring to and get out her
boats. The mate of the other went into the cabin,
told the accident, and advised lying by, and sending
their boats to assist their consort; but the captain
being ill, and willing to get off the coast, bid him
keep on his way, for it would be dangerous; having
400 slaves on board; and being but weakly
manned, when the boats were gone they might
rise upon him. The mate urged the danger of the
pirates, should they leave their consort. The captain
answered, the seas were wide, and he would
not bring to; accordingly they kept on their way
with a fresh gale.</p>

<p class='c000'>Two days after, the mate, about 8 in the morning,
ordered a man to the mast-head, who spied a
sail, which made them prepare for an engagement.
There was on board one Robert Williams, who had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>served the African company three years on the
Guinea coast, who spoke the negro tongue very
well. He told the slaves he had picked out, to the
number of 50, that the ship in sight he believed
would fight them, and if they got the better, would
certainly, as they were cannibals, kill and eat them
all; and therefore it behoved them to fight for their
lives. They had lances and small arms given them.</p>

<p class='c000'>About 10, Cornelius came up with them, and being
hailed, answered he was a man of war, in search
of pirates, and bid them send their boat on board;
but they refusing to trust him, though he had English
colours and pendant flying, the pirate fired a
broadside, and they began a running fight of about
10 hours, in-which time the negroes discharged
their arms so smartly, that Cornelius never durst
attempt to board. About 8 at night the ship blew
up abaft. They immediately cut the lashings of
the long-boat, but the ship going down, they had
not time to get her out, and barely enough to launch
the yawl, which lay on the forecastle. The ship
went down on one side, and Robert Williams running
on the other, was hooked by the mizen-truss,
and was carried down with her; but having his
knife in his hand, and a great presence of mind, he
cut the waistband of his trowsers, where he was
caught, got clear, and swam after the boat, into
which about 16 had gotten, and either knocked
those on the head, or cut off their hands, who laid
hold on it; however, with much entreaty, he was
permitted to lay one hand on to ease him. They
made to the pirate, who refused to receive them,
without they would enter with him: which, to save
their lives, they all agreed to, and were then civilly
received, and dry clothes given them. These and
one negro were all the souls saved.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a little time after this he took two Portuguese
ships, which he plundered and kept with him; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>one foggy morning, hearing the firing of guns, which
by the distance of time, he judged to be minute
guns, as they really were, for the death of an English
commander, he called his men on board from
the prizes, sent them about their business, and directed
his course by the report of the cannon he had
heard. In about two hours he spied the ship that
had fired, came up with her very soon, and took her
without resistance. The officers of the ship which
blew up, finding this prize English, and that the pirate
did not intend to detain her begged to be discharged,
as they had all large families, which must
perish without their support. Cornelius, taking
them into considerations, discharged Mr. Powis of
Limehouse, who has since been a commander, and
raised a fortune. The then chief mate, Mr. George
Forelong, the boatswain, carpenter, and other
married men, he set on board the prize, and was
very generous to them out of the plunder of the
Portuguese ships, because they had made a broken
voyage; but Robert Williams and the other
bachelors he detained, and forced some out of the
prize, which he let go.</p>

<p class='c000'>After this he took three Portuguese ships at an
anchor, which he plundered and burnt, after he had
hove down by one of them. He continued some
time longer on the coast, did a great deal of mischief
to the trade, and forced a great many men.
These he put to do all the slavery of the ship, and
they were beat about the decks, without daring to
resent it. I shall take notice of an instance of this
kind, to show how far revenge will carry a man.
One Robert Bland was at the helm, and called Robert
Williams to take whipstaff, till he went to play.
Williams refused it; upon which Bland drubbed him
with the lanyard of the whipstaff very severely.
Williams, that he might revenge himself, and have
liberty to fight Bland, went that instant and entered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>himself a volunteer in the ship’s books, and asked
leave to fight Bland, which was allowed him, but
with no other weapons than his fists. He, however,
challenged his antagonist, who was too hard for
him; so he turned pirate to be heartily thrashed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cornelius, thinking they had been long enough on
the Guinea coast, doubled the Cape, off which he
spied the Lizard, and two more men of war, under
the command of Commodore Littleton. Cornelius
was for giving chase, but finding his men unwilling
there being, as they gave for reason, 70 forced
men on board, and these ships being, as they suspected,
men of war, he made the best of his way
for Madagascar, went up the river Methelage, or
the west side, and anchored against Pombotoque,
a small village of blacks.</p>

<p class='c000'>The quarter-master went ashore, and the black
governor examined him, for several of these blacks
speak English. He told the governor they were
come for provision and to trade; upon which he
sent a couple of oxen on board, and then ordered
some of the inhabitants to go up with the quarter-master
to the king. The boat’s crew seeing a number
of blacks come down to the strand without the
quarter-master, apprehended some mischief had
befallen him; but were eased of their fears, when
they saw two oxen given them, and were told the
white man, who was gone to the king, would be back
next day, it not being above 20 miles from the shore.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the quarter-master, who carried up a blunderbuss,
a fine gun, and a pair of pistols, for a present
to the king, told him they wanted provisions, he
asked where they were bound? To which he answered,
to seek their fortunes, for at present they
were very poor. <em>Look ye</em>, replied the king, <em>I require
nothing of you; all white men I look upon as
my children; they helped me to conquer this country,
and all the cattle in it are at their service. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>will send down provisions enough, and when that is
spent, you shall have more.</em> He accordingly sent 1000
head of cattle, out of which he bid them choose
what they would, and they salted 100 fat oxen.</p>

<p class='c000'>Besides the present of oxen, the king sent 100
blacks laden with rice. Cornelius sent him a present
of two barrels of powder, and would have given
him more, with small arms in return, but he sent
them word he would have no more, nor any of their
arms, not being in want of either. On the contrary,
if they wanted, he would send them ten barrels of
powder, as they were his children; bade them proceed
on their voyage, and if they were richer when
they came back, and would send him any present,
he would accept it, but not now, they were so poor.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here Cornelius lost 70 men by their excesses.
Having been long without fresh provisions, the eating
immoderately, and drinking <em>toke</em> (a liquor made
of honey) to excess, threw them into violent fevers,
which carried them off.</p>

<p class='c000'>The blacks having given Cornelius an account
of the Speaker’s having sailed from Methelage
about three months before for the East-Indies, he,
having taken in his provisions, steered the same
course, in hopes to join in consort with her; but
the Speaker lying off the Red Sea, and the Morning
Star going into the Gulf of Persia, they never met.
They run up a pretty way in the gulf, and lay under
Antelope Island, where they kept a look out, and
whence they made their excursions, and took a
number of prizes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here they designed to heave down and clean, and
they had got a good part of their goods and water
casks ashore, when the look-out discovered two
lofty ships, one of them wearing a flag at the fore-top-mast-head.
This put them into great confusion:
they got what casks and necessaries they could on
board, and lay till the ships came abreast of them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>Then they got under sail at once, their sails being
furled with rope yarns, and came close alongside
the larger ship, which was a Portuguese of 70 guns,
as the other was of 26. They exchanged a broadside
with her, and the smaller ship engaged so
close, that they threw hand grenades into each
other; but Cornelius’ business was to run, and the
great ship put in stays twice to follow him, but
missing, was obliged to ware, which gave the pirate
a great advantage. The small ship, in staying,
tailed aground: she, however, gave chase till she
had run a good way ahead of her consort, which
the pirate seeing, brought to, and stayed for her, as
did the Portuguese for her consort, not caring to
engage him singly. When it was quite dark, Cornelius
ran up the other shore, passed the Portuguese
ships (which kept down the gulf) and came
again to anchor at his old station, where he found
his enemies had been ashore in their boats and staved
his casks. He here cleaned, and finding no
money to be got out of any prizes made, and bale
goods being of little value to them, they from hence
went away to the island of Johanna, where it was
designed to maroon the blacks, who were the greater
number and all bred among the English. Robert
Williams, fearing they would next maroon the
English, who were not above a third of the whites,
gave the negroes notice of the design, who secured
all the arms of the ship, and gave Williams the
command till they should get to Madagascar, keeping
a good guard on the French and Dutch. When
they came to Methelage they gave the ship to the
king, her bottom being eaten so much with the
worms that she was no longer fit for service; and
they all went and lived with the king. About five
months after they broke up, Cornelius died, and
was buried with the usual ceremony.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>
  <h3 id='WILLIAMS' class='c007'>CAPTAIN DAVID WILLIAMS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>This man was born in Wales, of very poor parents,
who bred him up to the plough and the following
of sheep, the only things he had any notion
of till he went to sea. He was never esteemed
among the pirates as a man of good natural parts,
perhaps on account of his ignorance of letters; for
as he had no education, he knew as little of the
sailing a ship, set aside the business of a foremast
man, as he did of history, in which, and natural philosophy,
he was equally versed. He was of a morose,
sour, unsociable temper, very choleric, and
easily resented as an affront, what a brave and a
more knowing man would not think worth notice;
but he was not cruel, neither did he turn pirate
from a wicked or avaricious inclination, but by
necessity; and we may say, though he was no forced
man, he could not well avoid the life he fell into.</p>

<p class='c000'>When he was grown a lusty lad he would see the
world, and go seek his fortune, as the term is among
the country youths, who think fit to withdraw themselves
from the subjection of their parents. With
this whim in his head, he got to Chester, where he
was received, and sailed on board a coaster, till
he had made himself acquainted with the rigging,
learned to knot, splice, and do the other parts of a
common sailor’s duty; then coming to London, he
shipped himself on board the Mary Indiaman, bound
for Bengal and Madras, which voyage he performed
outward, and it was not his fault that he did not
come home in the same ship; for, in her return,
falling short of water, they steered for the island of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>Madagascar, and fell in with the east side, in lat.
20 deg. or thereabouts. The captain manned and
sent ashore the long-boat to seek for water, but a
large surf running, she came to an anchor, at some
little distance from shore, and David Williams, with
another, being good swimmers, stripped and swam
off in search of water. While they were ashore,
the wind, which blew full upon the island, and
freshening, caused the surf to run too high for them
to get off; and the long-boat, after waiting some
time, seeing no possibility of getting these men on
board, weighed and stood for the ship, which filled
her sails and stood for St. Augustin’s Bay, where
she watered, and proceeded on her voyage.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus our poor Welchman and his companion
were left destitute on an island altogether unknown
to them, without clothes or subsistence but what
the fruits of the trees offered. They rambled some
little time along the coast, and were met by the
natives, and by them carried up into the country,
where they were humanely treated, and provided
with all the necessaries of life, though this was not
sufficient to expel his consort’s melancholy, who
took his being left behind so much to heart, that he
sickened and died in a very little time.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some time after, the prince of the country, who
entertained Williams, had a quarrel with a neighbouring
king, which broke into a war. Williams
took the field with his patron, but the enemy being
superior in number, got the victory, and took a
great many prisoners, among whom was the unfortunate
Welchman. The king whose prisoner he
was, treated him very kindly; and being master of
an old musket, gave it him, saying <em>such arms were
better in the hands of a white man than those of any
of his subjects, who were not so much used to them; that
he should be his friend and companion, and should fare
as well as himself if he would assist him in his wars</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>It will not be amiss here to take notice, that this
island, on the east side is divided into a great number
of principalities or kingdoms, which are almost
in continual war one with another; the grounds of
which are very trivial, for they will pick a quarrel
with a neighbour, especially if he has a number of
cattle, (in which, and slaves, consist their riches)
on the slightest occasion, that they may have an
opportunity of plunder; and when a battle or two
is lost, the conquered makes his peace, by delivering
up such a certain number of bullocks and slaves
as shall be demanded by the victorious prince. On
the west side the island, the principalities are mostly
reduced under one prince, who resides near Methelage,
and who is, as we have said in the lives of
other pirates, a great friend to white men; for his
father, who founded his empire by the assistance of
the Europeans, left it in charge with his son, to assist
them with what necessaries they should require,
and do them all friendly offices; but if he disobeyed
this command, and should ever fall out with
the white men, or spill any of their blood, he threatened
to come again, turn him out of his kingdom,
and give it to his younger brother. These menaces
had a very great effect on him, for he firmly
believed his father would, on his disobedience,
put them in execution; for there is not on earth, a
race of men equally superstitious.</p>

<p class='c000'>But to return to Williams, he lived with this prince
in great tranquility, and was very much esteemed
by him, (for necessity taught him complaisance.)
After some time, his new patron was informed that
his vanquished enemy had formed a grand alliance,
in order to make war upon him; wherefore, he resolved
to begin, and march into the countries of
the allies, and ravage the nearest before they could
join forces. He raised an army, and accordingly
marched southward. At the news of his approach,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>the inhabitants abandoned all the small towns, and
sending messengers to their friends, raised a considerable
body to oppose him, suffering him to over-run
a great deal of ground without molestation. At
length being reinforced, they took their opportunity,
and setting upon him when his men were fatigued,
and his army encumbered with booty, they
gained a signal victory. The king had the good
luck to get off, but Williams was a second time taken
prisoner.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was carried before the conqueror, who,
(having been an eye witness of his bravery, for
Williams killed a number of his enemies with his
shot, and behaved very well, defending himself
with the butt end of his musket for some time,
when he was surrounded) reached him his hand,
and told him, he made war with his enemies only,
that he did not esteem the white men much<a id='t169'></a>, but
should be glad of their friendship. Here Williams
was used with more respect than he had been even
by his last patron, and lived with this prince some
years; but a war breaking out, he was routed in a
set battle, in which Williams was his companion.
In the pursuit, the poor Welchman, finding he could
not get off, clapped his musket at the foot of a tree,
and climbing up, he capitulated. He was now terribly
afraid of being cut to pieces, for he had shot
and wounded a great number of the enemy. They,
however, promised him good quarter, and kept their
word.</p>

<p class='c000'>The king of Maratan, who took him, used him as
well as any of the former had done, and carried him
always with him to the wars, in which fortune was
more propitious, for the parties Williams commanded
had constantly the better of their enemies, and
never returned without great booties of cattle and
slaves, for all the prisoners they take are so, until
redeemed; though these prisoners are, for the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>part, women and children, they seldom giving quarter
to any other. The fame of his bravery and success,
spread itself round the country; and his name
alone was so terrible, that the giving out he was at
the head of any party, was giving the enemy an
overthrow without a battle.</p>

<p class='c000'>This reaching the ears of Dempaino, a mighty
prince who lived 200 miles from him, and who had
several petty princes tributaries, he sent an ambassador
to demand the white man; but his patron,
who had no mind to part with him, denied that he
had any white man with him; that he who was
called so was a native of the country. For the reader’s
better understanding this passage, I must inform
him, that there is a race of what they call white
men, who have been settled on Madagascar, time
out of mind, and are descended from the Arabs;
but mixing with the negroes, have propagated a
race of mulattoes, who differ in nothing from the
manner of living of the black natives.</p>

<p class='c000'>To proceed, the ambassador desired to see this
man, and Williams coming to him, being extremely
tanned, he had passed for what he was reported,
had he been before apprized of what had been said,
to have answered accordingly, for he spoke the language
perfectly; or had the ambassador not examined
him; who, after he had some time viewed
him, asked him of what country he was, and whether
it was true that he was one of Madagascar?
Williams answered, he was an Englishman, and was
left in the country, relating the particulars, as I have
already set them down, adding, he had been five
years in the island.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ambassador then told the king, that he must
send the white man with him, for such were the orders
of his master, the great Dempaino, who was
lord over most of the kings on the side of the country
where he resided; and that it would be dangerous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>for him to disobey the commands of so great a
monarch.</p>

<p class='c000'>The king answered, those who were subject to
Dempaino ought to obey his commands; but for
him, he knew no man greater than himself, therefore
should receive laws from none; and with this
answer dismissed the ambassador; who, at his return,
reported to his master the very words, adding,
they were delivered in a very haughty strain. Dempaino,
who was not used to have his commands disputed,
ordered one of his generals to march with
6000 men, and demand the white man, and in case
of refusal, to denounce war; that he should send
him back an express of it, and he would follow in
person with an army to enforce a compliance.</p>

<p class='c000'>These orders were put in execution with the
greatest despatch and secrecy; so that the town was
invested, before any advice was given of the approach
of an enemy. The general told the king, it
was in his choice to have peace or war with his
master, since it depended on the delivery of the
white man. The king, thus surprised, was obliged,
however contrary to his inclinations, to give Williams
up to the general, who returned with him to
Dempaino, without committing any hostilities;
though he threatened to besiege the town, and put
all but the women and children to the sword, if the
king of Maratan did not pay the expense of sending
for the white man, which he rated at 100 slaves, and
500 head of cattle. The king objected to this as a
hard condition, and an unjust imposition, but was
obliged to acquiesce in it.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was received by Dempaino with a great many
caresses, was handsomely clothed according to the
country manner, had slaves allotted to wait on him,
and every thing that was necessary and convenient;
so that king Dempaino was at the trouble of sending
6000 men, one would think, for no other end
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>than to show the great value and esteem he had
for the Europeans. He continued with this prince
till the arrival of a ship, which was some years after
his leaving Maratan, when the Bedford galley, a
pirate, commanded by Achen Jones, a Welchman,
came on the coast, on board of which ship Williams
was permitted to enter. They went to Augustin,
where, laying the ship on shore, they broke her
back by carelessness, and lost her. The crew lived
here till the arrival of the Pelican, another pirate,
mentioned in North’s life; some of them went on
board this ship, and steered for the East-Indies.
Williams shifted out of this on board the Mocha frigate,
a pirate, commanded by Capt. Culliford, and
made a voyage; then, returning to St. Mary’s they
shared the booty they had got in the Red Sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some of the crew, being West-Indians, having
an opportunity, returned home; but Williams remained
here till the arrival and taking of Captain
Fourgette, which has been already mentioned. He
was one of those who took the Speaker, went a
voyage in her, and returned to Maratan. Here the
king seeing him, asked him, what present he intended
to make him for former kindness? Williams
answered, he had been overpaid by the prince whom
he took him from, and by his services; which answer
so irritated his Maratanian Majesty, that he
ordered him to quit his country; and he could hardly
alter that see him with patience.</p>

<p class='c000'>From hence he went on board the Prosperous,
Capt. Howard, commander, who went to St. Mary’s,
and thence to the main, as is said in that pirate’s
life, and was one of the men left behind when they
had a design to carry off Ort Van Tyle. This Dutchman
kept him to hard labour, as planting potatoes,
&amp;c. in revenge for the destruction and havoc made
in his plantations by the crew of the Prosperous.
He was here in the condition of a slave six months,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>at the expiration of which time, he had an opportunity
to run away, leaving his consort, Thomas Collins,
behind him, who had his arm broke when he
was taken by the Dutchman.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having made his escape from a rigid, revengeful
master, he got to a black prince, named Rebaiharang,
with whom he lived half a year. He from
hence went and kept company with one John Pro,
another Dutchman, who had a small settlement on
shore, till the arrival of the men of war, commanded
by Commodore Richards, who took both Pro and
his guest Williams, put them in irons on board the
Severn, till they came to Johanna, where the captain
of the Severn undertook for $2000 to go against
the Mohilians, in which expedition several of the
man of war’s crew were killed, and the two pirates
made their escape in a small canoe to Mohila, where
they sheltered themselves awhile in the woods, out
of which they got provisions, and made over for
Johanna. Here they recruited themselves and went
away for Mayotta. The king of this island built
them a boat, and giving them provisions and what
necessaries they required, they made for and arrived
at Madagascar, where, at Methelage, in lat. 16
deg. 40 m. or thereabouts, they joined Captain White.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here they lay about three months; then setting
fire to their boat, they went into White’s, and rounding
the north end, came to Ambonavoula. Here
Williams remained till Capt. White bought the ship
Hopewell, on board of which he entered before the
mast, and made a voyage to the Red Sea, towards
the end of which he was chosen quarter-master.
At their return they touched at Mascarenhas for
provisions, where almost half the company went
ashore and took up their habitations.</p>

<p class='c000'>From Mascarenhas they steered for Hopewell (by
some called Hopeful) Point, on Madagascar, where,
dividing their plunder, they settled themselves.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>Twelve months after, the Charles brigantine
Capt. Halsey, came in, as is mentioned in his life.
Williams went on board him and made a voyage.
At their return they came to Maratan, lived ashore,
and assisted the king in his war against his brother,
which being ended in the destruction of the latter,
and a pirate lying at Ambonavoula, sending his long-boat
to Manangcaro, within ten leagues of Maratan,
Williams and the rest went on board, and in three
months after he had been at Ambonavoula, he was
chosen captain of the Scotch ship, mentioned in Halsey’s
life. This ship he worked upon with great
earnestness, and made the Scotch prisoners labour
hard at the fitting her up for a voyage; and she was
nearly ready for sea, when a hurricane forced her
ashore, and she was wrecked.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some time after this he set up and finished a
sloop, in which he and ten of his men designed for
Mascarenhas; but missing the island, they went
round Madagascar, to Methelage, where he laid his
vessel ashore and tarried a year; but the king being
tired with his morose temper, and he disagreeing
with every body, was ordered to be gone, and accordingly
fitting up his vessel, he put to sea, intending
to go round the north end of the island; but
the wind being at E. S. E. and the current setting
to N. W. he put back to a port called the Boyn,
within ten leagues of Methelage, in the same king’s
dominions whom he had left. The governor of this
place was descended from the Arabs, and it was
here that the Arabians traded.</p>

<p class='c000'>When he came to an anchor, he and three of his
men (he had but five with him) went on shore, paddled
by two negroes. David Eaton and William
Dawson, two of the men, required a guide, to show
them the way to the king’s town; the governor
ordered them one, and at the same time laid an
ambush for them in the road, and caused them to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>be murdered. When they had left the Boyn, Williams
and Meyeurs, a Frenchman, who also came
ashore in the canoe, went to buy some samsams,
which are agate beads. As they were looking over
these goods, a number of the governor’s men came
about them, seized them both, and immediately
despatched Meyeurs. Williams they bound, and
tortured almost a whole day, by throwing hot ashes
on his head and in his face, and putting little boys
to beat him with sticks. He offered the governor 2000
dollars for his life, but he answered, he would
have that and the money too; and accordingly,
when he was near expiring, they made an end of
him with their lances.</p>

<p class='c000'>After this barbarous murder, the governor thought
of seizing the sloop, on board of which were no
more than two white men, six negro boys, and
some women slaves of the same colour. However,
he thought it best to proceed by stratagem, and
therefore putting a goat and some calabashes of
toke on board Williams’ canoe, with twelve negroes
armed, and the sloop negroes to paddle, he sent to
surprise her. When the canoe came pretty near
the vessel, they hailed, and asked if they would let
them come on board? One of the men asked Williams’
negroes where the captain was? He answered,
drinking toke with the governor, and sent them
provision and toke. A negro wench advised the
white man, whose name was William Noakes, not
to let them come on board, for as four white men
went ashore, and none of them appeared, she suspected
some treachery. However, on the answer
made him from the canoe, he resolved to admit
them, and called them on board. No sooner were
they come on deck, than one of them, snatching
Noakes’ pistol, shot him through the head, and
seizing the other white man, threw him overboard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>and drowned him; after which, being masters of
the vessel, they carried her in and rifled her.</p>

<p class='c000'>The king was at this time hunting, as is his custom
to hunt boars three months in the year; but
an account of these murders soon reached him.
However, he continued the accustomed time of
his diversion; but when he returned home, and the
whites who were about him demanded justice, he
bade them be quiet, they might depend upon his
doing it. He sent to the governor of Boyn, and
told him, he was glad that he had cut off Williams
and his crew, an example he was resolved to follow,
and clear the country of them all; that he had
some affairs to communicate to him, and desired he
would come to court as soon as possible, but take
care he was not seen by any of the whites, for fear
they should revenge the death of their companions.</p>

<p class='c000'>The governor, on these orders, came away immediately,
and stopped at a little town, two miles
distant from the king’s, and sent word he there
waited his commands.</p>

<p class='c000'>The king ordered him to be with him early
next morning, before the white men were out of
their beds. He set forward accordingly the next
day betimes, but was seized on the road by negroes
placed for that purpose, and brought bound to the
king, who, after having reproached him with the
barbarity of the action he had been guilty of, sent
him to the white men, bidding them put him to
what death they pleased; but they sent word back,
he might dispose of the lives of his subjects as he
thought fit, but for their part, they would never draw
a drop of blood of any who belonged to him. Upon
which answer the king’s uncle ordered him to be
speared, and he was accordingly thrust through the
body with lances. The king, after this execution,
sent to Boyn, and had every thing brought which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>had belonged to Williams and his men, and divided
it among the whites, saying, <em>he was sorry the villain
had but one life, to make atonement for the barbarity
he had been guilty of</em>.</p>

<h3 id='BURGESS' class='c007'>CAPTAIN SAMUEL BURGESS.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Captain Samuel Burgess was born in New-York,
and had a good education. He sailed some
time in a privateer in the West-Indies, and very
often, the gang he was with, when the time of their
cruising was expired, would make no ceremony of
prolonging the commission by their own authority.</p>

<p class='c000'>By his privateering he got together some little
money, and returned home, where the government
having no notice, or at least taking none, of his
piratical practice, in staying beyond the date of his
commission, he went out mate of a ship, in the service
of Frederick Phillips, bound to the island of
Madagascar, to trade with the pirates, where they
had the misfortune to lose their ship, and lived 18
months at Augustin, when an English pirate coming
in, the king of the country obliged him to go on
board her, though much against his inclination, for
he was tired of a roving life: but their choice was
to go or starve, for the king would keep them no
longer.</p>

<p class='c000'>He went with this freebooter to the East-Indies,
where they made several rich prizes, and returned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>to St. Mary’s, where they took in provisions, wood,
and water. Several of their gang knocked off here;
but the captain, Burgess, and the remainder, went
away for the West-Indies, disposed of their plunder
on the Spanish coast, and then returning to New-York,
purposely knocked the ship on the head at
Sandy Hook, after they had secured their money
ashore.</p>

<p class='c000'>The government not being informed of their
piracy, they lived here without molestation, and, in
a short time, Burgess married a relation of Mr.
Phillips, who built a ship, called the Pembroke, and
sent him a second time to Madagascar. In his way
to this island, he went into the river of Dilagou on
the African coast, where he took in a quantity of
elephant’s teeth; and thence to Augustin, where
he met with several of his old ship-mates, with
whom he traded for money and slaves. Leaving
this place, he went to Methelage, where he also
took some money and negroes; and from thence
he shaped his course for St. Mary’s, on the east
side, where he also drove a considerable trade with
his old comrades, took several of them passengers,
who paid very generously for their passage; and
taking with him an account of what was proper to
bring in another trip, he returned to New-York,
without any sinister accident. This voyage cleared
£5000, ship and charges paid.</p>

<p class='c000'>His owner, encouraged by this success, bade him
choose what cargo he pleased, and set out again.
Accordingly he laded with wine, beer, &amp;c. and
returning to Madagascar, arrived at Maratan, on the
east side, where he disposed of a great part of his
cargo at his own rates. At Methelage he disposed
of the rest, and returned, clearing for himself and
owner, £10,000, besides 300 slaves he brought to
New-York.</p>

<p class='c000'>After a short stay at home, he set out again on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>the old voyage, fell in first with Methelage, where
he victualled and traded, and from thence went
round the south end, and sold part of his cargo at a
large profit, to his old acquaintance. He made a
trading voyage round the island, and at St. Mary’s
met another ship belonging to his owner, which had
orders to follow his directions. He remained at this
port till he had disposed of the cargoes of both ships.
He then shaped his course homewards, with about
twenty pirate passengers, who had accepted the
pardon brought by Commodore Littleton.</p>

<p class='c000'>In his way he touched at the Cape of Good Hope,
for wood, water, and fresh provision. While he was
here, the Loyal Cook, an East-Indiaman, came in,
who made prize of Burgess, and carried him to the
East-Indies. He there would have delivered Burgess’
ship to the governor of Madras, but the governor
would have no hand in the affair, and told the
captain, he must answer to the East-India company
and Burgess’ owner for what he had done.</p>

<p class='c000'>Most of the pirate passengers thought themselves
cleared by the act of grace; but some, not willing
to trust to it, got off with what gold they could, in a
Dutch boat. They who trusted to the pardon, were
clapped in gaol, and died in their irons. I cannot
omit the simplicity of one of them, who had, however,
the wit to get off. When he designed to go
away, he looked for his comrade for the key of his
chest, to take his gold with him, which amounted to
seventeen hundred pounds; but this comrade being
ashore, he would not break open the chest, for it
was a pity, he said, to spoil a good new lock; so
left his money for the captain of the East-Indiaman.</p>

<p class='c000'>The news of this capture came to the owner before
the ship returned, and he sued the Company;
but at their request, waited for the arrival of the
Loyal Cook, which brought Burgess prisoner to
England soon after. The Captain finding himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>in an error, and that what he had done could not be
justified, absconded; and the Company made good
the ship and cargo to the owner. Burgess was set
at liberty, continued some time in London, was impeached,
and piracy sworn against him by Culliford,
who, notwithstanding he came home on the act of
grace, was committed to Newgate, tried, and acquitted,
though he was beggared.</p>

<p class='c000'>Burgess’ owner laboured very hard, and expended
great sums of money to save him. However,
though he pleaded the necessity of his going on
board the pirate, he was tried and condemned; but
by the intercession of the bishops of London and
Canterbury, was pardoned by the queen.</p>

<p class='c000'>After this, he made a broken voyage to the South
Sea, lieutenant of a privateer, and returning to London,
was out of business a whole year. He then
shipped himself as mate on board the Hannah, afterwards
called the Neptune, and went to Scotland to
take in her cargo, the owner being of that country;
but before she got thither, he broke, the ship was
stopped, and lay eighteen months before she was
disposed of. At length, being set to sale, six Scotch
gentlemen bought her, the old officers were continued,
and she proceeded on her first designed voyage
to Madagascar, in which the captain and Burgess
quarrelling, caused the loss of the ship; for
the latter, who was acquainted with the pirates,
when they arrived at Madagascar, instigated them
to surprise her. The manner how, being already
set down in Halsey’s life, I need not repeat.</p>

<p class='c000'>I shall only take notice, that Capt. Miller being
decoyed ashore, under pretence of being shown
some trees, fit for masting, Halsey invited him to
a surloin of beef, and a bowl of arrack punch; he
accepted the invitation, with about twenty pirates.
One Emmy, who had been a waterman on the
Thames, did not come to table, but sat by, muffled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>up in a great coat, pretending he was attacked by
the ague, though he had put it on to conceal his
pistols only. After dinner, when Halsey went out,
as for something to entertain his guests, (Miller and
his supercargo,) Emmy clapped a pistol to the captain’s
breast, and told him he was his prisoner. At
the same instant, two other pirates entered the
room, with each a blunderbuss in his hand, and
told the captain and his supercargo, that no harm
should come to either, if they did not bring it upon
themselves by an useless resistance. While this
passed within doors, the wood being lined with
pirates, all Miller’s men, whom he had brought
ashore to fall timber, were secured, but none hurt,
and all civilly treated. When they had afterwards
got possession of the ship, in the manner mentioned
before, they set all their prisoners at liberty.</p>

<p class='c000'>Miller with eleven of his men, was sent off, as is
said in Halsey’s life. The company chose Burgess
quarter-master, and shared the booty they had
made out of the Scotch ship, and the Greyhound.</p>

<p class='c000'>Soon after happened Halsey’s death, who left
Burgess executor in trust for his widow and children,
with a considerable legacy for himself; and the
other pirates grumbling at a new comer’s being preferred
to all of them, took from Burgess £3000 of
Halsey’s money, and £1200 of his own, which was
his share of the two prizes. Though he had been
treated in this manner, they were idle enough, to
give him the command of the Scotch ship, and ordered
him to fit her out with all expedition, and to
take on board some men and goods left in the brigantine.
He set to work on the ship, with full design
to run away with her; but some pirates, who
were in another part of the island, being informed
of these proceedings, thought it not prudent to trust
him, so he left the ship, and getting among his old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>comrades, by their interposition had all his money
returned.</p>

<p class='c000'>After this he lived five months on the island of
St. Mary’s, where his house was, by accident, burnt
down, out of which he saved nothing but his money.
He then went on board David Williams, when he
missed the island of Mascarenhas, and returned to
Methelage, where he tarried with the king, and was
one of the men among whom he divided Williams’
effects.</p>

<p class='c000'>From Methelage he went with a parcel of samsams
to Augustin, with which he bought fifty slaves,
whom he sold to the Arabians. In his return to
Methelage, he met Capt. North, in a sloop, with 30
of Miller’s men on board. These men proposed
taking Burgess, who had, as they said, betrayed, ruined,
and banished them their country, by forcing
them to turn pirates; but North would not consent:
upon which they confined him, took Burgess and
stripped him of all the money, and then releasing
their captain, gave him £300 as his share, which he
returned to Burgess on his arrival at Methelage.</p>

<p class='c000'>Burgess lived here two or three years, till he was
carried off by some Dutchmen. They belonged to
an East-Indiaman, and were taken by two French
ships, which being bound for Mocha, and short of
provisions, came into Methelage to victual, where
they set 80 of their prisoners ashore. When they
parted from this port, they sailed for Johanna, where
they left the Dutch officers, who built a ship, and
came back for their men. Burgess being of great
use to them, they took him on board, and steered
for a port, where some Dutch, taken in another
ship, were marooned; but they were wrecked at
Youngoul, where Burgess continued 18 months.
After this time was expired, he was desirous of leaving
the place, and addressed himself to the king,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>who was uncle to the king of Methelage, he requested
his black majesty to send him back to that
port, which he readily complied with, where Burgess
continued almost five years, afflicted with sickness,
in which he lost one eye. While he was here, the
Drake pink, of London, came in for slaves. He took
Burgess, with design to carry him home; but Capt.
Harvey, in the Henry, which belonged to the same
owners, arriving, and being a stranger to the trade,
at the request of Capt. Maggot, commander of the
Drake, and on promise of a ship when in the West-Indies,
he entered as third mate, and continued with
him. Captain Harvey carrying it pretty high, and
disagreeing with the king, lay here nine months before
he could slave. Burgess was sent up to tell
the king he had not fulfilled his agreement with
Capt. Harvey. The king resented being reproached
by a man whom he had entertained so many years,
and reviled him. He was, however, carried to dinner
with some of the principal blacks, and drank
very plentifully with them of toke, in which it is supposed
he was poisoned, for he fell ill and died soon
after, leaving what he had to the care of the chief
mate, for the use of his wife and children.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>
  <h3 id='NORTH' class='c007'>CAPTAIN NATHANIEL NORTH.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Captain North was born at Bermuda, and was
the son of a sawyer, which business he himself was
bred up to, but took at last to the seas, at the age
of 17 or 18, shipping himself cook on board a sloop,
built at Bermuda, for some gentlemen of Barbadoes,
with design to fit her out for a privateer. She was
bound to her owners, but the master took Santa
Udas in the way, and loaded with salt. When they
came to Barbadoes, all the crew was pressed, and
North with his companions were put on board the
Reserve.</p>

<p class='c000'>The master applied himself to the governor, and
got all his men cleared, North excepted, who, as he
was a lad, was neglected, and left on board the man
of war, which soon after sailed for Jamaica. Some
time before the Reserve was relieved from this station,
he laid hold of an opportunity to run away,
and shipped himself on board a sugar drover, in
which way of life he continued about two years, and
being an able sailor, though no artist, he was offered
to go master of one of these coasters, which he refused,
and went on board a privateer.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first cruise he made, they took a couple of
good prizes, which made every man’s share very
considerable; but North, as he got his money lightly,
so he spent it, making the companions of his dangers
the companions of his diversions, or rather
joining himself with them, and following their example;
which all (who are acquainted with the way
of life of a successful Jamaica privateer) know is
not an example of the greatest sobriety and economy.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>His money being all spent, he took the same
method for a recruit, that is, he went a second time
privateering, and met with such success, that he engaged
very heartily in this course of life, and made
several lucky cruises. Some time after, he grew
tired, thought of trading, and shipped himself on
board a brigantine, bound for the Spanish coast,
commanded by one Capt. Reesby. This vessel
went both on the trading and privateering account,
so that the men shipped for half wages, and equal
shares of what prizes they should make, in the same
manner as to the shares, as on board a privateer.
Their trading answered very poorly, and their privateering
business still worse, for they returned without
making any prize. They were forced to leave
the Spanish coast on account of a Spanish guarda-la-costa,
of 40 guns and 350 Frenchmen, commanded
by a captain of the same nation. When
they made the island of Jamaica, they fell in with
Bluefields, off which place two French privateer
sloops were cruising, one of which was formerly a
privateer of Jamaica, called the Paradox. They
immediately clapped Captain Reesby on board,
taking him for a trader from the Spanish coast, and
weakly manned. However, they were soon sensible
of the mistake, for Reesby took one of them,
and the other was obliged to a good pair of heels for
his safety. Reesby lost 10 men killed outright in
the engagement, and had 7 wounded. The latter,
though he had made but a broken voyage, he put
ashore at Bluefields, and ordered great care to be
taken of them, at the owners’ expense. Here he
took in fresh provision, and then beat up to Port
Royal, where Reesby paid his men very honourably,
gave them a handsome entertainment, and begged
they would not leave him, as he had a very great
value for them all; but for North particularly, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>was a good swimmer, managed a canoe with great
dexterity, and feared nothing.</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon this desire of the captain’s, North and the
greater part tarried ashore till Capt. Reesby was
refitted, and went a second voyage with him to the
coast, at seventeen dollars a month, and no share.
They carried 300 negroes, besides bale goods, and
disposed of all the slaves and goods to great advantage.
Upon their return to Jamaica, after some
stay on the island, Capt. Reesby not going out again,
North went once more a privateering, and made
considerable booty. While North was ashore after
a cruise, he was pressed on board the Mary man of
war, made a cruise in her to the Spanish coast, and
returned to Jamaica; but hearing the Mary was
soon to go to England, he, and three more, resolved
to swim ashore from the keys, where the men of
war lay<a id='t186'></a>, but he was taken as he was going off the
head, and whipped. He, however, found means to
make his escape, before the ship left the island, and
went on board the Neptune sloop, a privateer, commanded
by Capt. Lycence, then lieutenant of the
Reserve, who, while the ship was in the carpenter’s
hands, got a commission of the governor to take a
cruise. Capt. Moses, who commanded the Reserve,
went on board their sloop, under the command of
his lieutenant, for diversion only. They cruised off
Hispaniola, where they met with a French letter-of-marque,
of 18 guns, and 118 men, who had the day
before engaged the Swan man of war, and shook
her off. The Neptune attacked her, and Capt.
Moses was one of the first wounded, and carried
down. Lycence ordered to board, but the quarter-master,
who steered, mistook the helm, the sloop
fell off, and the French pouring in a volley of small
shot, Capt. Lycence was killed, which being told to
Moses, as the surgeon dressed him, he ordered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>North to the helm, bid them not to be discouraged,
and he would be upon deck immediately. Accordingly,
he came up as soon as dressed, laid the ship
on board, where they made a very obstinate resistance;
but the French captain being killed, who received
eleven shot before he dropped, they, at
length, became masters.</p>

<p class='c000'>The privateer lost 10 men, and 20 were wounded.
The French had 50 killed and wounded, among
whom was the captain, who had received two shot,
as he was going down to the surgeon to get his
blood stanched, and came upon deck just as he
was boarded, where, encouraging his men, he was
distinguished and aimed at. When they had brought
the prize into Jamaica, as she was an English bottom,
built at Bristol, and called the Crown, the former
owners sued to have half the ship and cargo,
and recovered one third.</p>

<p class='c000'>Capt. Moses’ ship not being fitted, he would take
a second cruise in a privateer, and North went with
him. Some time after their return, Capt. Moses being
cruising in the Reserve, North, who was ashore,
was pressed on board the Assistance man of war;
and on the Reserve’s coming in, being recommended
by Capt. Moses to his own captain, he was handsomely
treated, and made one of the barge’s crew.
He was very easy till the Assistance was ordered to
England, and then, as he was apprehensive of going
into a cold climate, he took his leave and said
nothing. He then went on board a privateer again,
and made several prizes, two of which were English
bottoms, and sued for by former owners. North
thinking it hard to venture his life, and have part of
his prize money taken away, and the press being
hot in Jamaica, he resolved to sail no more with the
English; but went to Curacoa into the Dutch service,
and sailed with a Spanish trader to the coast
of New Spain several voyages. In the last he made,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>they were chased ashore by a couple of French
sloops, one of which was commanded by a Dutchman,
named Lawrence, who, with his comrade, took
possession of their vessel and rifled her. The crew
of the prize called to them, and asked if they would
give them good quarters? which they promised; took
them all on board, and used them very handsomely.</p>

<p class='c000'>The French gave the prisoners a small sloop they
took a while after, and they returned to Curacoa.</p>

<p class='c000'>He having now forgot his resentment, returned to
Jamaica, and went on board and cruised in a Spanish
barcalonga, of 10 guns, commanded by Capt. Lovering,
born at Jamaica. They cruised three months
in the West-Indies, and making but a small hand of
it, they steered for Newfoundland, to try their fortune
on the banks. Here they met a man of war, who
renewed their commission for six months longer.
The first prize they made was a French ketch, with
a Spanish pass, and would have passed for a Spaniard,
but by strict search, and threatening the men, they
discovered her to be what she really was, though
she had, as a Spaniard, slipped through the fingers
of a man of war before.</p>

<p class='c000'>They carried their prize into harbour, went again
upon a cruise, met with a French letter-of-marque,
a Bristol built ship, called the Pelican, of 18 guns,
and 75 men, half laden with fish. This ship stood
them a long argument; they clapped her on board,
and two of their men entered, but missing lashing,
the barcalonga fell astern, and the two men were
made prisoners. However, they came up with her
again, clapped her on board a second time, and carried
her into the same port where they had left the
ketch.</p>

<p class='c000'>They after this put to sea again, and being discovered
by the French settlement ashore, they went
into St. Mary’s Bay, where they fell in with a large
French fly-boat, of 800 tons, 80 men, and 18 guns,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>laden with fish. They chased and came up with
her, under French colours. When they were pretty
near, the Frenchman hailed, and asked whence they
came? A Guernsey-man, at the bowsprit end, answered,
<em>from Petit Guave</em>, that they had been cruising
on the Banks, and were going into the bay for
refreshment. The Frenchman bade them come no
nearer, but send their boat on board. They keeping
on the chase, he fired at them. They did not
mind this, but run up along side and boarded him.
The French ran to their close quarters, and disputed
the ship three quarters of an hour, when they all
called for quarters except one man, who would take
none, but ran like a madman into the midst of the
English, and wounded several, though he was soon
despatched by their pistols. They carried this prize
to join the others, and turning all the prisoners
ashore, except what were necessary to condemn
their prizes, they stood, with a fleet of four sail, for
Rhode-Island.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here they condemned the fly-boat and ketch, but
found great difficulty in getting the Pelican condemned,
the English owners putting in their claim;
but, at length, a Scotch lawyer did their business,
upon leaving £300 in his hands to bear the charge
of any future suit. Capt. Lovering dying here, the
ship’s company bought the Pelican, broke up the
barcalonga, sent her owners their shares, and got a
commission for the master to cruise southward as far
as the line, and to be valid for 18 months certain,
two years allowing for accidents.</p>

<p class='c000'>They fitted this ship for a long voyage, out of the
joint stock of the company; but iron hoops being
scarce in New-England, they were obliged to take
casks hooped with wood, which I mention, because
it proved the ruin of their voyage to the East-Indies
for a whole year.</p>

<p class='c000'>Being fitted for sea, they set sail and steered for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>the Cape of Good Hope, which they doubled in the
month of June, made the best of their way to Madagascar,
and went into Augustin Bay, where they
victualled and watered; but before this was done it
was August, which was too late to go to the East-Indies;
which they proposed to do with design to
cruise on the Moors, not intending to pirate among
the Europeans, but honestly and quietly to rob what
Moors fell in their way, and return home with clean
consciences, and clean, but full hands, within the
limited time of their commission.</p>

<p class='c000'>From Augustin they went to Johanna, and the
provision they had salted at Madagascar not being
well done, it began to spoil. This, and their clothes
wanting repair, made them desperately resolve to
take the king of Johanna and make him ransom himself;
but the master would not take charge of the
ship, being unacquainted with the coast. They
cruised among the islands, landed at Comaro, and
took the town, but found no booty, excepting some
silver chains, and checked linen. From hence they
went to Mayotta, where they took in a Frenchman
who had been marooned there, and maintained by
the king. They consulted with him about surprising
and taking the town; but he was averse to it,
as he owed him the obligation of being preserved.
However, he was in their hands, and must do as
they would have him. They surrounded the king’s
house after they had been three days in his town,
and took him and all the inhabitants; but the king’s
son made his way through the thickest of them with
his cutlass, though he was shot afterwards. The
pretence they made use of for this unjustifiable violence,
was, that the king had poisoned the crew of
a ship, which was their consort. He denied it, as
well he might, for they themselves never heard of a
ship of the name they gave this fictitious one. The
king they carried on board, the other prisoners they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>put into a sort of temple, with a guard over them of
36 men.</p>

<p class='c000'>The alarm being given in the country, the natives
came down in a body, of some thousands, and attacked
the guard; but the ship hearing the fire, and
seeing the hills covered with blacks, discharged several
great guns, loaded with partridge, which made
a very great slaughter, and obliged them to retire.</p>

<p class='c000'>The king ransomed himself for some silver chains
to the value of a thousand dollars, and for what provision
they demanded; and at setting him ashore,
swore allegiance to them as masters of the country,
and took an oath besides, never to poison any more
white men.</p>

<p class='c000'>After this notable expedition, they stayed here a
fortnight, though always on their guard, and then
went back for Augustin with about twenty slaves,
which they carried away with them for servants.
Here a sickness coming among them, they built
huts ashore. They lost, notwithstanding all their
care and precaution, their captain and thirty men,
by the distemper which they contracted; but it
abating, they thought of going to sea again, but on
examining their water casks, they found the hoops
all worm eaten and rotten, so that there was no
proceeding; but this defect was repaired by their
cooper, who was an ingenious fellow. He went into
the woods with the Mayotta slaves, and with withes
and other stuff he gathered, fitted them up, and
made them tight; in acknowledgment of which service
they chose him captain, and North was made
quarter-master.</p>

<p class='c000'>At Augustin they picked up some stragglers,
among whom was David Williams, and on a muster,
they found they had 105 men. They then made
their vessel a free ship; that is, they agreed every
man should have an equal share in all prizes; and
proceeded for the mouth of the Red Sea.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>In the night, after they had reached their station,
they made two ships; one was the Mocha frigate,
of 40 guns, commanded by Culliford: she had been
an East-Indiaman, under the command of one Capt.
Stout; the other ship was called the Soldada, of 16
guns, the captain’s name Shivers; they hailed one
another, and on both sides gave the same answers,
<em>from the seas</em>, and upon agreement, they all lay by
that night. In the morning they consorted, and
agreed to make an equal division of all prizes, which
any of the three should take from that time for two
months to come.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Pelican spared wood, water, and some
of her hands to Capt. Culliford, and here Williams
shifted on board him. About ten days after these
three had joined company, a large Moor’s ship,
on which they afterwards mounted 70 guns, hove in
sight.</p>

<p class='c000'>They all gave chase, but the small ship came
first up with the Moor, who exchanged several shot
with the Soldada and Pelican; but the Soldada clapped
her on board, and before the Pelican could enter
a man, the Moors called for quarters. In boarding
the Moor, she fired a broadside upon the Soldada,
but only two shot hulled her, and killed two men,
which was the only loss they had in taking a thousand
prisoners, passengers and sailors.</p>

<p class='c000'>All the money was carried on board the Mocha
frigate, and divided between her crew and the Soldada,
excluding without other reason than <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sic volumus</span></i>,
the Pelican from any share. The crew of
the Pelican expostulated with them, and bid them
remember they had spared both wood and water, or
the Mocha could not have kept the station. Instead of
any answer, they received a command to be gone, or
they would sink them. They answered, they could
not go by themselves, wanting the water and wood
they had spared. The two consorts gave them a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>thousand dollars, and some water out of the Moor,
telling them to buy wood, where they could purchase
it, and so left the Pelican to herself, going
away for the coast of Malabar, where they put the
prisoners and horses they had taken ashore, sunk
the Soldada, and thence went to the Isle of St.
Mary’s on Madagascar. They shared out of this
prize a thousand pounds a man in silver and gold,
besides other goods; and the two pirates amounted
to the number of 350 men.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Pelican kept the same station for some days,
when a large Moor ship hove in sight. They gave
chase, and the Moor not suspecting her for an
enemy, did not endeavour to get away. When the
Pelican came up, she fired for the Moor to bring to,
which made him set his small sails, though with the
loss of several men; for the Pelican being close up,
brought them down with small arms. When the
Moor had, at length, hove out his small sails, the
Pelican could not gain upon him enough to board,
though she was not a pistol shot astern. Whenever
she came upon his lee quarter, the Moor being a
tall ship, took away the wind from the Pelican, and
she could never get to windward of him. She plied
her fore chase all this while, and drove the Moor’s
from their stern chase, but could not, as they endeavoured
to do, strike the Moor’s rudder, or any
other way disable him. At length by the fear and
bad steerage of the Moor, the Pelican run up alongside
of them, but as she missed lashing, she was obliged
to shoot ahead. In the mean while the Moor
wore round, the Pelican put in stays after him, but
not staying, and being all in confusion, wore also;
but in this time the Moor had got the start, and
setting all the canvass he could pack on his ship’s
back, wronged the Pelican and got off.</p>

<p class='c000'>The loss of this ship made the crew almost distracted,
and caused for some time, a great division
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>among them; some cursing the ship for a heavy
sailer, and proposing to return home; others cursing
themselves, and the ill-management by which
they missed lashing, and proposed going to Madagascar,
and breaking her up, since as she was a
single bottom, she must be worm eaten; but time,
which mollifies the greatest rage, abated these contentions,
and put an end to the animosities which
sprung from their disappointment.</p>

<p class='c000'>They now resolved for the Malabar coast, on
which they took three Moor ships in a little time.
The first they discharged, after taking out 6000
dollars; the second they took for their own use,
mounted her with 26 guns, and called her the Dolphin:
the third they sold on the same coast for
18,000 dollars. Their own ship they set adrift.
From this coast they made for Madagascar, and
near the island of Mascarenhas lost all their masts
in a hurricane. They put up jury masts, came to
St. Mary’s and new masted. Here they found
Captain Culliford, Capt. Shivers, and their prize,
with three merchantmen from America, which had
come to trade with them, one of which was the
Pembroke, commanded by Samuel Burgess, and
belonging to Frederick Phillips, merchant, at New-York.
The captain of the Dolphin, and some of
the men being weary of this life, went home in these
merchants ships, and the crew chose one Samuel
Inless, who lived on the island, for their captain.
They fitted out for the Straits of Malacca, where
they made several prizes of Moor ships, but of little
value to them. North, on board one of the prizes,
was separated from the rest by bad weather, and
drove to great distress for water. The Moor merchant,
who was on board with him, and whom he
had treated very humanely, showed him a draught,
by which he came to a small island not far from the
Dutch settlement, and watered. The Moor told
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>him, that he ran the risk of his life should it be
known that he had given him a sight of this draught.
In return for this service, when he met with his companions,
he got the Moor’s ship discharged. After
this they steered for Nicobar, near Achen, and, in
the way, met a large Danish ship, which they plundered,
and hove down by, cleaned, and returned to
Madagascar, where they shared their booty, which
was, besides goods, between 3 and £400 a man. A
month after their arrival, Commodore Littleton’s
squadron appeared in sight, which occasioned their
hauling up the Dolphin; and, as they could not get
her so high as they designed, they set fire to her.</p>

<p class='c000'>Commodore Littleton brought a pardon for such
of the pirates as would accept it, and many of them
did, among whom were Culliford and Shivers, who
went home with merchantmen. North accepted
it also, but would not trust to it, finding the time
fixed for their surrender had elapsed before the
men of war arrived.</p>

<p class='c000'>Most of the pirates having left the island of St.
Mary’s, where the king’s ship lay, North thought
it not safe for him to stay, and therefore putting all
he had into the Dolphin’s boat, he designed to join
his comrades on the main of Madagascar; but being
overset by a squall, all the people were lost except
himself, who swam ashore, and a negro woman
whom he put on the bottom of the boat.</p>

<p class='c000'>Being now on the main, and quite naked, he
frightened the negroes he met with, as he got out
of the water, for they took him for a sea-devil; but
one women, who had been used to sell fowls at the
white men’s houses, had the courage not to run
away, and, when he came near, knew him. She
gave him some of her own clothing, and calling a
negro man who carried her things, and had run into
the woods, they helped him to perform his journey
to the dwelling of some white men, which was sixteen
miles from the place where he came on shore.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>Being quite exhausted, he was kindly received and
clothed by his comrades, whom he remained with
till he had recovered his strength, and then went
to a black prince of his acquaintance, with whom
he tarried till the arrival of Capt. Fourgette, which
was full a year.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this vessel, which I have already said in White’s
life was taken, he went round the north end to the
west side, and came into Methelage, where they
surprised the Speaker; the manner of which is also
mentioned in the same life; and, after the death of
Capt. Booth, was chosen captain’s quarter-master,
by Bowen, who succeeded in the voyage, and the
consequence of it are already set down, for he was
in the Speaker till she was lost.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next voyage he made was in the Speedy
Return (taken from Capt. Drummond) in the capacity
of company’s quarter-master, with design to
cruise in the Red Sea; but touching at the island of
Mayotta, they consorted with Capt. Howard, whom
they met with at the island, as is already said.
From thence they went and victualled at Augustin,
having promised Capt. Bowen to meet him in two
months; accordingly returning thither, and missing
him, they went to Mayotta to inquire after him;
but hearing that he was gone a voyage, and as the
place of rendezvous was off the highlands of St.
John’s, they steered their course thither, to join
him, and lie for the Moor fleet for Mocha.</p>

<p class='c000'>In their passage they met with a violent storm,
in which they were near foundering. It beat in
their stern, and obliged them to throw over all their
guns (two excepted, which lay in the hold) and
forced them into the gulf of Persia, where they
took several small vessels, which they ripped up to
repair their ship. Being very much in want of water,
having staved all their casks, to save themselves in
the storm, and meeting with little in the vessels
taken, they hoisted out the canoe to chase a fishing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>vessel, that they might be informed where they
should find water. This boat made from them with
all their force, but the ship firing, the people all
leaped into the water, some of whom were drowned,
and the rest got ashore, except one man, whom
they came up with; but as soon as they thought
to lay hold of him, he dived, and kept them in play
near an hour and a half. They would not shoot
him, because it did not answer their ends; but at
length North, who was in the boat, took the sprit,
and struck him as he rose, and broke his jaw.
They took him by these means, brought him on
board, sent him to the surgeon, and when they
despaired of his being able to speak, he asked for
a pipe of tobacco, which he smoked, and drank a
dram; after which he seemed very hearty. As the
pirates had on board several black slaves, who
spoke the East-India tongue, one of them was ordered
to inquire of him where they might find water,
promising him his liberty if he would direct
them. On this promise he carried them to a convenient
landing place, where he showed a well, full of
dirt, out of which, after a great deal of trouble to
come at it, they drew but three buckets of water,
which sufficed those only who went on shore, to the
number of thirty. Enraged with this disappointment
after so much labour, they threatened their
prisoner with death, who told them, if they would
have patience till the sun was set, they would have
plenty, for the spring would rise, and flow all night;
which they found to be the fact, and filled twenty
tons of water, and returned on board, carrying the
man with them, for whom they made a gathering
of some goods, and about 30 dollars. These they
gave him, and exacted a promise, that whenever
he saw any ship on that coast, which made the
same signals they had made, he would go on board
and render them what service he could, assuring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>him he would always meet with civil treatment,
and be well rewarded.</p>

<p class='c000'>After this they cruised in the gulf of Persia some
days, in hopes of meeting their consort, not doubting
but she had some share in the storm; but the
time of their partnership having at length expired,
and she not appearing, they steered for the highlands
of St. John, near Surat, the place of rendezvous.
When they made the land they spied a ship,
and immediately making all clear for an engagement,
they gave chase. The other ship doing the
like, they soon met, and to the great joy of both parties,
she proved their consort. Upon inquiry they
found the Prosperous had been ten days on this
station, and had not met with the storm which had so
roughly handled the Speedy Return. On giving an
account of their misfortune, viz. their being obliged
to throw over their guns, and a quantity of provisions,
Capt. Howard spared them some fresh provisions,
and expressing great concern for the accident,
renewed his consortship for two months
longer; that is, they agreed whatever prizes were
taken should be equally divided between the crews
of both ships. After they had cruised here fourteen
days, they spied seven sail of lofty ships, which
proved to be the Moors from Mocha. They both
gave chase, but the Speedy Return being the better
sailor, first came up with one of them, laid her
on board and carried her in very little time, with
little more damage them the loss of her bowsprit.
The Prosperous continued the chase, and having
Capt. Whaley on board as a pilot, took another at
an anchor, as is related in Capt. Howard’s life.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Speedy Return steered with her prize for the
coast of Malabar, where, by agreement, she was to
wait ten days for her consort. In six days the Prosperous
joined them, but without any prize, having
rifled and dismissed her.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>Here they made an equal dividend of their prizes,
burnt the Speedy Return, sunk the Prosperous, went
all on board the Moor’s ship, put to sea, and cruised
on this coast, where they made several prizes.
When they came over against Cachine, some black
merchants, goldsmiths, and several Dutchmen, came
on board to trade with them, bringing a great many
sequins, and other gold coin, to change for Spanish
dollars. As many of the pirates designed to knock
off and return home, they gave 500 dollars for 200
sequins, for the conveniency of close stowage about
them. The goldsmiths set up their forges on board
the ship, and were fully employed in making them
buttons, buckles, and what else they fancied, so that
they had a fair opportunity of putting in what alloy
they thought proper. They here also furnished
themselves with a good quantity of arrack, provisions
and stores, and then leaving the coast, shaped
their course for Madagascar, but, in the way, fell in
with the island of Mauritius, and put into a port
called the North West Harbour. Here they wooded
and watered. This port affords great abundance of
a poisonous fish called the Red-Snapper, the nature
of which was well known to Capt. Bowen, who persuaded
his men not to eat of them, but they were
in port, and then are all commanders, so that this
wholesome advice was thrown away upon them.
The captain seeing their obstinacy, and that they
could not be dissuaded, eat with them, choosing
rather to share the same fate, than be left alone to
the mercy of the Dutch, as he was conscious of what
he merited. They supped plentifully on the fish,
and drank very heartily after it. Soon after they
began to swell in a frightful manner. The next
morning some planters came on board with fowls,
goats, &amp;c. and seeing the pirates in a miserable
condition, and some of these fish lying on the decks,
asked if they had not eaten of them? Being answered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>in the affirmative, they advised their drinking
plentifully of strong liquors, which was the only
way to expel the poison, which had dispatched
them all in less time, had they not done it after their
unfortunate meal. They readily followed this advice,
as the prescription was agreeable, and by this
means, with the care of the surgeons, of whom they
had several expert in their business, and stocked
with good medicines, they all recovered, four excepted,
who paid their obstinacy with their lives.</p>

<p class='c000'>They here heeled their ship, scrubbed, tallowed,
and took in what they wanted. When they had
been three months in this port, the governor sent
and desired them to put to sea, for he expected the
arrival of the Dutch East-Indiamen. They accordingly
got every thing ready, and went out, but left
several of their men behind them, as we have related
in Bowen’s life.</p>

<p class='c000'>From hence they steered to Madagascar, and in
their passage stopped at Don Mascarenhas, where
they took in a quantity of hogs, goats, sheep, fowls
of all sorts, and green turtle. Captain Bowen here
went ashore with 40 of his men, having obtained
the governor’s protection by the force of presents.
These men designed to give over their piracy, and
return home the first opportunities offered them.
In six months after they landed here, Capt. Bowen
was taken ill of the dry belly-ache, a distemper as
common here as in the West-India Islands, died,
and was buried in the highway, for the priests would
not allow him holy ground, as he was a heretic.</p>

<p class='c000'>But to return. When Bowen went ashore, North
was chosen captain. The ceremony of this installation
is as follows:—The crew having made choice
of a person to command, either by an unanimous
consent, or by a majority of suffrages, they carry
him a sword in a very solemn manner, make him
some compliments, and desire he will take upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>him the command, as he is the most capable among
them; that he will take possession of the great cabin:
and, on his accepting the office, he is led into
the cabin in state, and placed at a table, where only
one chair is set at the upper end, and one at the
lower end of the table for the company’s quarter-master.
The captain and he being placed, the latter
succinctly tells him, that the company having
experience of his conduct and courage, do him the
honor to elect him for their head, not doubting his
behaving himself with his usual bravery, and doing
every thing which may conduce to the public good;
in confidence of which, he, in the name of the company,
promises to obey all his lawful commands,
and declares him captain. Then the quarter-master
takes up the sword, which he had before presented
him, and he had returned, puts it into his
hand, and says, <em>This is the commission under
you are to act; may you prove fortunate to yourself and
us</em>. The guns are then fired round shot and all; he
is saluted with three cheers; and the ceremony
ends with an invitation from the captain to such
as he thinks fit to have dine with him, and a
large bowl of punch is ordered to every mess.</p>

<p class='c000'>Capt. North, leaving this island, steered for Madagascar,
and came to Cape Dolphin at the south
end, where he anchored, and took on board some
refreshments, but it blowing hard, he was obliged
to put to sea, and leave his boat with 30 men behind
him. He ran along the east side of the island,
and came to Ambonavoula, in lat. 17 deg. 38 m.
where they put on shore some of their goods, and
settled themselves among the negroes, several
living in a house. Here they lived as sovereign
princes among the inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Moor prisoners they kept on board, and allowed
them sufficient fresh provisions. North privately
told the boatswain of the Moors to take advantage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>of the land breeze in the night time, and
go off with the ship, and what goods were left on
board, or the pirates would soon haul her up, take
every thing on shore, and they never see their own
country again. Accordingly the boatswain, following
this advice, laid hold of the opportunity of
a dark night, and communicating his design to the
other Moors, whom he did not acquaint with this
advice, as North charged him not, till he was on
the point of executing his design, they weighed
with great silence and stood to sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next morning some of the pirates proposed
to go on board and bring off some iron and other
things to trade with in the country; but they were
strangely surprised when they missed the ship.
They alarmed the rest of their comrades, and went
in a body to Capt. North, to tell him what had happened.
He answered, if the Moors were gone off
with the ship, it was their own fault; they ought to
have left a sufficient number of hands on board to
have secured her; and there was now no remedy
but patience, for they had no vessel to pursue with,
except they thought the canoe proper.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some of the pirates thought, as she lay in foul
ground, the cable might be cut by some rock, and
the ship blown off to sea by that accident. On starting
this, some of them ran up to an eminence, and
from thence spied the ship as far as they could
well see, with all sail set, which was a cruel and
convincing proof that their loss was irreparable.</p>

<p class='c000'>They endeavoured to make themselves easy,
since there was no help; and transporting their
goods to different abodes, at small distances, they
settled themselves, buying cattle and slaves, and
lived in a neighbourly manner, one among another,
five years, cleared a great deal of ground, and
planted provisions, such as yams, potatoes, &amp;c.
The natives among whom they fixed, had frequent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>broils and wars among themselves, but the pirates
interposed, and endeavoured to reconcile all differences,
North deciding their disputes with that impartiality
and strict regard to distributive justice,
(for he was allowed, by all, a man of admirable
good natural parts) that he ever sent away, even
the party who was cast, satisfied with the reason,
and content with the equity of his decisions.</p>

<p class='c000'>These inclinations which the pirates showed to
peace, and the example they set of an amicable way
of life, (for they carefully avoided all jars, and agreed
to refer all cause of complaint among themselves
which might arise, to a cool hearing before North,
and twelve of their companions,) gave them a great
character among the natives, who were before very
much prejudiced against the white men. Nay, in
this point of keeping up a harmony among themselves,
they were so exact, that whosoever spoke
but in an angry or peevish tone, was rebuked by all
the company, especially if before any of the country
people, though even but a slave of their own; for
they thought, and very justly, that unity and concord
were the only means to warrant their safety; for the
people being ready to make war on one another
upon the slightest occasion, they did not doubt but
they would take the advantage of any division which
they might observe among the whites, and cut them
off whenever a fair opportunity offered.</p>

<p class='c000'>The example they set, and the care they took to
accommodate differences among their neighbours,
had calmed all the country round them. After
they had lived here near three years, Capt. North,
and some of his companions, had a mind to visit the
country southward, and trade for more slaves and
cattle; to which end, taking a considerable quantity
of powder and arms, beside what they might use,
with 50 whites and 300 natives, he set forward on
his journey. When they had traveled about 80
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>miles southward, they came to a nation rich in
slaves and cattle, who inhabited the banks of the
largest river on the east side of the island, called
Mangora. With these people he trafficked for a
great number of slaves and cattle, which he purchased
for guns and powder. They being at war
when Capt. North came among them, with a neighbouring
prince, he was entreated to give his assistance,
for which they, the Mangorians, promised
him 100 slaves with 500 head of cattle, and all the
prisoners they should take. On these conditions he
joined them, and marched to a very large town of
the enemy’s, which was naturally very strong, and
esteemed by the natives impregnable, being situated
on a high and craggy rock, which could be
ascended by the way only leading to the gate, where<a id='t204'></a>
was kept a strong guard. The blacks in North’s
army were for leaving this town unattempted, and
marching farther into the country, in search of
booty; but North told them it was not safe to leave
a garrison of enemies at their backs, which would
continually infest them by falling on their rear, and
which would be an obstacle to their carrying off
what plunder they might get together; beside, it
would be an asylum for all the country, which would
fly thither till they had gathered a body considerable
enough to come down and face them in the
open field, which the enemy might do with reasonable
hopes of success, as their men would be all
fresh, while those of his party would be fatigued
with marches, perhaps encumbered by plunder, and
worn down with the inconveniences of lying exposed
in the fields.</p>

<p class='c000'>The chief of his allies allowed his reasons good,
were an attempt on the town practicable, which
experience told him was not; for, though several
times besieged, it never could be taken, and it would
be the loss of a great deal of time, and many men’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>lives to attempt it. North desired he would leave
the management of this siege to him. The chief
answered, he should do as he pleased, but it was
against his judgment to attack a town which nature
herself had fortified, which God Almighty would
never suffer to be taken, and which had, to no purpose,
cost the lives of a number scarce to be told,
of his countrymen, in the several attempts they had
made to be masters of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>North disposed his army, and invested the rock
on every side; then sent word to the town, if they
did not surrender, he would give no quarter to
either sex or age. The inhabitants laughed at his
message, and told him, that they did not believe he
had learnt the art of flying, and till he had, they
thought themselves very secure from his putting
such menaces in execution.</p>

<p class='c000'>Out of the white men, North chose 30, whom he
set at the head of three companies, consisting of 100
blacks each; and as they had some grenade-shells
with them, soon dispersed the guard at the foot of
the rock, and made a lodgement. Though the
blacks were acquainted with fire-arms, the shells
were entirely new to them, and as they saw their
terrible effect, threw down their arms, and gained
the middle of the rock, where they had another
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corps de garde</span></i>, though not without some loss.
Those who were at the bottom of the rock being
put to flight, North sent 10 whites and 500 blacks
to take that post, and orders to the other whites to
mount the rock, and having beat that guard, if possible,
to enter the town with them. They accordingly
ascended in this order, as the road was so
narrow, only three could pass abreast; and as the
enemy, when within cast of a dart, threw down a
shower upon them, three unarmed blacks with their
shields marched before three small shot men, and
sheltered them from the enemy’s weapons. These
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>were followed by others, with the same precaution,
the white men being mixed with those who
thus went up, that is to say, one white musketeer
to two blacks.</p>

<p class='c000'>The enemy seemed resolute to defend the pass,
but when they had, to no purpose, spent a number
of darts, and had lost some men by the shot, they
swiftly took to the top of the rock, where, joined
with fresh men from the town, they made a stand
and show of resistance. North’s men followed, and
pouring in a volley, put them into confusion, which
gave the assailants an opportunity to come near
enough to throw in their shells, half a dozen of
which bursting with considerable damage, and the
slaughter of several men, they thought to shelter
themselves in the town, but the inhabitants, fearing
the enemy’s entering with them, shut the gates
against both, so that the blacks of North’s army,
notwithstanding all the whites could do to the
contrary, made a great slaughter; however, they
saved some, whom they sent prisoners to the
camp, desiring at the same time, a supply of powder
to make a petard.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the mean while the enemy from the town
threw a prodigious quantity of darts, which the
besiegers received upon their shields, at least,
the greater part.</p>

<p class='c000'>The town was again summoned, but they refused
to surrender; wherefore they were obliged to shelter
themselves as well as they could, and expect
the powder from the camp; though in the mean
while the small shot from without being warmly
plied, the throwing of darts from the town became
less frequent, for no one could show his head but
with the greatest danger.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the powder came, they cut down and hollowed
a tree, which they filled with powder, and
plugged up very tight, and under the protection of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>their shields and muskets, got into the gate, under
which they dug a hole large enough to receive it,
then setting fire to the fuse, it burst with a terrible
crack, tore their gate to atoms, and left an open
passage, which the besiegers, who had been joined
with 500 more blacks, who came up with the powder
entered, and began a very great slaughter.
The whites protected all they could who submitted,
but notwithstanding their diligence, the town was
strewed with dead and dying men. At length, what
with being tired, and what with persuasion, the
slaughter ceased, the town was reduced to ashes,
and the conquerors returned to camp with 3000
prisoners, whom his allies led to their own quarters,
where culling out the old women, children,
and useless slaves, they sent them to North, as if
by these they thought themselves released from
the promise made to induce his assistance.</p>

<p class='c000'>When North saw the dishonesty of these people,
he sent for their prince, and told him, “According to
agreement all the slaves belonged to him; nay,
according to justice, he alone had a right to them,
since he despaired of taking the town, so far as to
dissuade his besieging it; and that he not only owed
to him their success, but even the safety of his
army, and all the plunder they should make in the
prosecution of the war, for reasons already given,
and by himself allowed to be good. That he thought
he had allied himself to a people of integrity, but
he was sorry to say, he found himself quite mistaken
in his opinion, since they were so far from making
good their treaty, that they sent him out of the slaves
taken, instead of all, those only whom they knew
not what to do with; that they must not imagine
him so blind as not to perceive how disingenuously
he was dealt with; or that he wanted either strength
or resolution to resent the usage.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He then asked what was become of a number of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>young and handsome women he had seen among
the captives? The prince answered, “that those
he inquired after, were his and his countrymen’s
relations, and as such, they could not consent to,
nor could he require, their being made slaves.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This answer made, the chief left him. As it was
delivered in a pretty haughty tone, it did not a little
nettle both North and his comrades. The latter
were for immediately doing themselves justice; but
the former begged they would have patience, and
rely on him. They followed his advice, and he sent
an interpreter, who inquired privately among the
women what relation they bore to the people of the
river? The prisoners answered, that some of their
forefathers had intermarried with that nation.</p>

<p class='c000'>I must here take notice, that notwithstanding the
inhabitants of Madagascar have but one language,
which is common to the whole island, the difference
of the dialect, in different nations, makes it very
difficult for any but the natives, or those who have
been a great many years (more than North and his
companions had been) among them, to understand
them perfectly, which is the reason he made use of
an interpreter, as well between him and the chief,
as between the slaves and him.</p>

<p class='c000'>When he had received this answer from the prisoners,
he went to the prince, and told him, “It
was very odd he should make war on his relations;
however, he should keep them, since he declared
them such, till he could prove his right better than
the prince could his nearness of blood; that as he
had once taken them, he would try if he could not
support the justice of his claim, and told him therefore
to be upon his guard, for he openly declared,
he was no longer the ally, but the professed enemy
of faithless people.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Saying this, he and his blacks separated themselves
from the Mangorians, and North divided them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>into companies, with his white men at the head of
each, and ordered them to fire ball over the heads of
their late allies. The first volley was a prodigious
astonishment to the Mangorians, several of whom
ran away, but North firing two more immediately,
and marching up to them, brought the prince and the
head officers of his army to him, crawling on all fours.
They (as the custom of showing the greatest submission
is among them) kissed the feet of the whites
and begged they would continue their friendship
and dispose of every thing as they thought proper.</p>

<p class='c000'>North told him, “Deceit was the sign of a mean
and coward soul; that had he, the prince, thought
too considerable, what, however, was justly his due,
because not only promised to, but taken by him, he
ought to have expostulated with him, North, and
told him his sentiments, which might have, it was
possible, made no division, for neither he nor his
men were unreasonable; but as the prince had not
the courage publicly to claim the slaves, he would
have basely stolen them by false pretences of kindred,
it was a sign he did not think such claim justifiable,
as certainly it was not, for all his captains could
witness their prince had agreed the prisoners taken
should be given to the whites, and his companions,
a sufficient title, to mention no other. That he had
resolved to show them, by a severe chastisement,
the abhorrence those of his colour have to ingratitude
and deceit, and what difference there was in
fighting on the ground of justice, and the supporting
wrong and injury; but as they acknowledged their
error, he should not only forgive but forget what
was past, provided no new treachery, in his return,
which he resolved upon, refreshed his memory.”
He then ordered them to bring all the slaves, and
they punctually complied without reply.</p>

<p class='c000'>North chose out the finest and ablest among
them, and dividing the whole number of prisoners
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>into two equal bands, he kept that in which he had
placed the chosen slaves, and sent the other to the
prince, telling him, “though neither fraud nor compulsion
could wring a slave from him, yet justice,
as some of his troops had shared the danger, and a
generous temper, had sent him that present, which
was half the spoil, though he could not think of going
any farther on with the war; that he ought to
content himself with the taking a town hitherto
thought impregnable, and blame his own conduct,
if he should continue in the field, and hereafter find
the want of his assistance.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The prince and his people admired the penetration,
bravery, and generosity of the whites, and
sent them word, “he was more obliged to them for
the lesson they had taught him by their practice,
than for the slaves they had presented him, though
he esteemed the present as he ought. That for the
future he should have an abhorrence for every mean
action, since he had learned from them the beauty
of a candid, open, sincere procedure. At the same
time, he thanked him for the present, and not suffering
his resentment to go farther than the frightening
him into his duty; for he was sensible his balls
were not fired over their heads, but by orders proceeding
from the humanity of the whites, who, he
observed, were tender over the lives of their enemies,
contrary to the custom of his countrymen,
who give quarter to none, the females and infants
excepted, that there may hereafter be none to take
revenge; and therefore begged he would suffer
their submission to get the better of his design to
depart.” This could not prevail. The whites and
their friends, who came with them, turned their
faces towards home, taking their slaves and cattle
with them; and though the Mangorians were sensibly
touched at the obstinacy of North’s resolution,
yet they parted very amicably.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>As the whites were returning home with their
company, they fell in with another nation, the Timouses,
whose prince joined North, with 500 men,
and swore a strict amity with him and his crew.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ceremony used among the natives, as it is
uncommon, so an account of it may, perhaps, be
agreeable. The parties who swear to each other,
interweave their toes and fingers, so that they must
necessarily sit very close to each other. When they
have thus knit their hands and feet, they reciprocally
swear to do each other all friendly offices, to
be a friend or enemy to the friend or enemy of the
party to whom they swear; and if they falsify the
oath they make, they imprecate several curses on
themselves, as may they fall by the lance, be devoured
by the alligator, or struck dead by the hand
of God. Then an assistant scarifies each of the
contracting parties on the chest, and wiping up the
blood with a piece of bread, gives this bloody bread
to each of them to eat, that is, each eats the blood
of the other; and this oath, whether it be with equal
parties, or with a prince and his subject, where the
one promises protection and the other obedience,
(which was the nature of that taken between North
and this prince) is looked upon inviolable, and they
have few examples of its being broken; but where
any has been wicked enough to violate this solemn
oath, they say, they have been ever punished according
to their imprecations.</p>

<p class='c000'>As this prince had war with powerful neighbours,
he left his country, taking with him all his
great men, wives, and relations, with a company of
about 500 fighting men, followed North, and settled
by him, where he remained two years. During
this space, being supplied with arms and powder
by Capt. North, he made several inroads into the
countries of his enemies, and made all he conquered
swear allegiance to Capt. North.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>At the expiration of two years, Captain Halsey
came in with a brigantine, as is related in the life of
Capt. White. This crew, having made a broken
voyage, where discontented with their captain, and
desired North to take the command upon him; but
he declined it, saying, Halsey was every way as
capable, and that they ought not to depose a man,
whom they could not tax with either want of courage
or conduct; and for his part, he would never
take the command from any one who did not justly
merit dismission, which was not Halsey’s case.</p>

<p class='c000'>The crew were not, however, satisfied, and they
made the same offer to White, but by North’s industry,
they were, at last, prevailed on to continue
their old commander; and as North and his companions
had expended their money in settling their
plantations, and wanted clothes, the former, therefore,
accepted the quarter-master’s post under Halsey,
and the others went in the capacity of private
gentlemen adventurers, I mean plain foremast men,
as may be gathered in the life of that pirate, to
which I refer for an account of the expedition they
made in the Red Sea. Capt. Halsey on board a
prize, left North to command the brigantine they
set out in. The two commanders were separated
by a storm, but both made for Madagascar Halsey
got to Ambonavoula, but North fell in with Maratan,
where finding the brigantine was very much
worm eaten, and made a great deal of water, with
one consent, they took ashore all their goods, and
laid up their vessel.</p>

<p class='c000'>The pirates continued here a whole year, when
being desirous of going to Ambonavoula, they asked
the king’s assistance to build a boat, and he, for
1000 dollars, set negroes to work, under the directions
of Capt. North, and a vessel of 15 tons was set
up and launched with great dispatch. In this
boat they went to a river, called Manangaro, thirty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>leagues to the northward of Maratan. Here some
of their comrades came to them in a boat belonging
to the Scotch ship Neptune, and helped to transport
their goods to Ambonavoula, where he had before
settled, and had a woman and three children.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had not been long returned before his neighbouring
natives reported, that the Timouses, who
had followed him from the southward, had a design
to rebel against, and murder him and the other
whites, which giving too easy credit to, he made
war upon, and drove these poor people out of the
country.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some time after he built a sloop, and went to Antonguil,
where he purchased 90 slaves, and took in
the Scotch supercargo, Mr. George Cruikeshank,
with a design to carry him to Mascarenhas; but all
his comrades were against it, saying, when he got
to Europe, he would prove their destruction. North
answered, that nothing could be more cruel, after
they had taken the greater part of what the poor
gentleman had, than to keep him from his country,
family, and friends. For his part, were he his prisoner
he should not ask their consent in doing an
act of humanity, and the only one they were able,
towards making him some reparation, since they
could not return his goods, which were parcelled
out into so many shares.</p>

<p class='c000'>On North’s saying thus much, they put the affair
in question to vote, and there being many who
were under obligations to North, and whom he influenced
in favour of the supercargo, 48 out of 54
voted for discharging him. North having gained
this point, the pirates asked if he also designed to
take with him one John Barnard, a young Scotchman,
a great favourite of his, who had been midshipman
on board the Neptune, a thorough seaman,
and very capable of taking the command in any
voyage. He answered, there was a necessity for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>taking him, since he should want his assistance, as
he depended on his knowledge. His companions
said Barnard would certainly give him the slip,
which would be a loss to them all, as he was an excellent
navigator, and therefore his detention was
necessary to the common good. To this North
answered, that his own security would oblige his
taking care that he should not get from him, since
no other on board was capable of finding the way
back to Ambonavoula.</p>

<p class='c000'>He went to Mascarenhas, where the supercargo
and his negro were put on shore with all the money
he had, which amounted to about 1600 dollars; for
when the pirates made prize of the Neptune, in the
manner already stated, they took none of the money
they themselves had before paid for liquors, &amp;c.
either from the captain, supercargo, or any other
on board; for that they looked upon a base, as well
as dishonest action; but to the ship and remaining
part of the cargo, they had a fair title, viz. they
wanted both.</p>

<p class='c000'>North would not suffer Barnard to go ashore.
However, to make him amends for his confinement,
he gave him four negroes, whom he sold for 300
dollars, and took care that he should live plentifully
and well on board. North’s business at this island,
was to get leave to carry his children there to be
educated in the christian faith, which, after some
rich presents made the governor, he obtained, and
returned to Madagascar. In the voyage, as Barnard
was very greatly in his favour, and his confidant,
he told him, his design was to leave his children
at Mascarenhas, and place fortunes for them
in the hands of some honest priest, who would give
them a christian education (for he thought it better
to have them papists, than not christians) and would
then go back to Maratan, and endeavour, by his penitence,
to make atonement for his former life and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>never more go off the island on any account; that
he would give his sloop to Barnard, with 200 dollars,
that he might find some means to return home,
since he very wisely refused to join with the pirates.</p>

<p class='c000'>When he came on the Madagascar coast, he
heard a French ship had touched there, and left
some men behind; upon which account North ran
to the southward 100 leagues out of his way, to inquire
after and assist these people.</p>

<p class='c000'>He found but one man, whom he took home with
him, clothed and maintained him. When he came
back to Ambonavoula, he found the country all in
an uproar, and the rest of his companions preparing
for a war with the natives; but his arrival restored
their former quiet. After four months stay at home,
he fitted his sloop to go out and purchase slaves at
Antonguil; but finding few there to his mind, for in
two months he bought but 40, he returned to his
settlement. He designed now to carry his children
to Mascarenhas, but being dissuaded by Barnard on
account of the season, he went to Methelage on the
west side of the island to trade for samsams. Having
purchased a considerable quantity of them, he
went to Johanna, thence to Mayotta, and returned
again to Madagascar; but not being able to get
round the north end, on account of the current, he
put for Mayotta again. On the west side of this
island he put into a port, called Sorez, where some
time before, came a ship from England to trade,
commanded by one Price, who going ashore with
his doctor was detained (as was also his boat’s crew)
till he redeemed himself and surgeon, with 200 barrels
of powder and 1000 small arms; but was forced
to leave his boat’s crew, not having wherewithal to
ransom them, though the demand was only two
small arms for each man. These poor creatures
were afterwards sold to the Arabians. In revenge,
North and his crew landed, burnt a large town, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>did all the damage they could. From Mayotta he
went again to Madagascar, where<a id='t216'></a> a king of his
acquaintance told him the whites and natives were
at war at Ambonavoula. He bought 30 slaves, refreshed
his crew, and went home. On the news of
his arrival, the natives sent to conclude a peace, but
he would not listen to them; on the contrary, raised
an army, burnt a number of towns, and took a
great many prisoners.</p>

<p class='c000'>This success brought the natives to sue in a very
humble manner for a cessation of arms, that a general
peace might follow. This he agreed to about
four months after his arrival.</p>

<p class='c000'>His enemies, having now the opportunity, corrupted
some of the neighbouring natives, and in
the night surprised and murdered him in his bed.
His comrades, however, being alarmed, took to
their arms, drove the treacherous multitude before
them with great slaughter, and to revenge
North’s death, continued the war seven years, in
which time they became masters of all the country
round, and drove out all who did not swear allegiance
to them.</p>

<p class='c000'>North had his will lying by him, which directed
Barnard to carry his children to Mascarenhas, in
his sloop, which he left to him. He was at the
charge of fitting her up, and laid out the greater
part of the money North bequeathed him; but the
pirates would not suffer him to stir while the wars
lasted, fearing he would not return, having never
joined them in any piracies; and therefore, by one
consent, setting fire to the sloop, they detained him
several years.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Of the piracies and cruelties of John Augur, William

Bendall, and William Ling, who were tried, condemned,
and executed at Nassau, (N. P.) on Friday,
the 10th of December, 1718. Also, some account
of the pirates, Vane, Rackham, and others.</em></p>

<p class='c000'>About the 20th of July, 1718, Mr. Woodes Rogers,
Governor and Vice-Admiral of the Bahama Islands,
being sent from England with the king’s proclamation
and pardon for all pirates who had surrendered by a
time specified in the said proclamation, arrived at
Providence. It was evening when the fleet came
off the town of Nassau in the said island, when
Richard Turnley, the pilot, did not judge it safe to
venture over the bar that night, wherefore it was
resolved to lay by till morning.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the mean time, there came some men on
board the fleet from off a little island, called Harbour-Island,
adjacent to Providence. The advice they
brought was, that there were near a thousand
pirates on shore upon the island of Providence, waiting
for the king’s pardon, which had been long expected.
The principal part of their commanders
were Benjamin Hornygold, Arthur Davis, Joseph
Burgess, Thomas Carter, and they were all in or
about the town of Nassau; that the fort was extremely
out of repair, there being only one gun
mounted, a nine pounder, and no accommodation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>for men, but one little hut or house, which was
inhabited by an old fellow, whom the pirates, in derision,
called Governor Sawney.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fleet was seen from the harbour, as well as
the town, so that Capt. Charles Vane, who had no
design of surrendering, but, on the contrary, had fitted
out his ship with a resolution of attempting new
adventures, took the advantage of the night to
contrive his escape; and though the harbour was
blocked up, and his ship drew too much water to
get out by the east passage, he shifted his hands,
and things of most value, into a lighter vessel, and
charging all the guns of the ship he quitted, with
double, round and partridge, he set her on fire, imagining
that some of the ships, or their boats, might
be sent near him, and he might do some mischief
when it should burn down to them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Those in the fleet saw the light, and heard the
guns, and fancied the pirates on shore were making
bonfires, and firing guns for joy that the king’s free
pardon had arrived; and Capt. Whitney, commander
of the Rose man of war, sent his boat with a lieutenant
on shore, which was intercepted by Vane,
who carried the crew on board and stripped them
of some stores they had in the boat. He kept them
till he got under sail, which was till day-break,
when there was light enough for him to see how to
steer his way through the east passage; which was
no sooner done but he hoisted a black flag, and fired
a gun, and then let the lieutenant and boat’s crew
depart and join the fleet.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fleet got safe into the harbour, and as soon
as the lieutenant arrived on board, and related what
had passed, the Buck sloop was ordered to chase
Vane. She made what sail she could through the
east passage after him, having a recruit of men well
armed sent to her from the other ships; but being
heavily laden with rich goods, Vane had the heels
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>of her, which the commodore observing, made a
signal for her to give up the chase and return,
which she did accordingly.</p>

<p class='c000'>They immediately fell to mooring and securing
their ships, which took up the time till night. Next
morning the governor went on shore, being received
at his landing by the principal people in the government
of the place, viz. Thomas Walker, Esq. Chief
Justice, and Thomas Taylor, Esq. President of the
Council. The pirate captains, Hornygold, Davis,
Carter, Burgess, Currant, and Clark, with some
others, drew up their crews in two lines, reaching
from the water side to the fort, the governor and
other officers marching between them. In the
mean time, being under arms, they made a running
fire over his head.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having arrived at the fort, his commission was
opened and read, and he was sworn in governor of
the island, according to form.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next day the governor made out a commission
to Richard Turnley, the chief pilot, to Mr.
Salter, a factor, and some others, to go on board
and examine all suspected ships and vessels in
the harbour, to take an inventory of their several
ladings, and to secure both ships and cargoes for
the use of the king and company, till such time as
a Court of Admiralty could be called, that they
might be lawfully cleared or condemned by proving
which belonged to pirates, and which to fair traders.</p>

<p class='c000'>The day following a court-martial was held, in
which a military discipline was settled, in order to
prevent surprises, both from Spaniards and pirates,
till such time as the fort could be repaired, and put
into a condition of defence. For this purpose the
governor was obliged to make use of some of the
pardoned pirates, such as Hornygold, Davis, and
Burgess, to whom he gave some commands: and
George Fetherston, James Bonney, and Dennis
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>Mackarthy, with some other pirates of a lower
rank, acted under them as inferior officers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Soon after, the civil government was also settled,
some of the principal officers being appointed
justices of the peace; others of inferior degree,
constables and overseers of the ways and roads,
which were overgrown with bushes and underwood,
all about the town of Nassau; so that if an enemy
had landed in the night, they might lie in ambuscade
in those covers, and surprise the town; wherefore,
several of the common pirates were employed
in clearing them away.</p>

<p class='c000'>The governor, with some soldiers, guarded the fort,
and the inhabitants, who were formed into trained
bands, took care of the town; but as there was no
sort of accommodation to lodge such a number of
people, they were forced to unbend the sails, and
bring them on shore, in order to make tents, till
they had time to build houses, which was done with
all possible expedition, by a kind of architecture
altogether new.</p>

<p class='c000'>Those that were built in the fort were done by
making six little holes in the rock, at convenient
distances, in each of which was stuck a forked pole;
on these, from one to the other, were placed cross
poles or rafters, which being lathed at top, and
on the sides, with small sticks, were afterwards
covered with Palmata leaves, and then the house
was finished; for they did not much trouble themselves
about the ornaments of doors and windows.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the mean time the repairs of the fort were carried
on, and the streets were ordered to be kept
clean, both for health and convenience, so that it
began to have the appearance of a civilized place.
A proclamation was published for the encouragement
of all such persons as should be willing to
settle upon the island of Providence, by which every
person was to have a lot of ground of a hundred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>and twenty feet square, any where in or about the
town of Nassau, that was not before in the possession
of others, provided they should clear said
ground, and build a house tenantable, by a certain
time therein limited, which might be easily done, as
they might have timber for nothing. This had the
effect proposed, and a great many immediately fell
to work, to comply with the conditions, in order to
settle themselves there.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many of the pirates were employed in the woods
in cutting down sticks to make palisadoes; and all
the people belonging to the ships, officers excepted,
were obliged to work four days in the week on the
fortifications, so that in a short time a strong entrenchment
was cast round the fort, and being well
palisadoed, it was rendered tolerably strong.</p>

<p class='c000'>But it did not much suit the inclinations of the
pirates to be set to work; and though they had provision
sufficient, and had also a good allowance of
wine and brandy to each man, yet they began to
have such a hankering after their old trade, that many
of them took opportunities of seizing periaguas,
and other boats, in the night, and making their
escape, so that in a few months, there was not many
of them left.</p>

<p class='c000'>However, when the Spanish war was proclaimed,
several of them returned back again of their own
accord, tempted with the hopes of being employed
upon the privateering account, for that place lying
near the coast of Spanish America, and also not far
from the Gulf of Florida, seemed to be a good station
for intercepting the Spanish vessels going to
old Spain.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were not mistaken in this supposition; for
the governor according to the power vested in him,
did grant commissions for privateering, and made
choice of some of the principal pirates who had continued
upon the island, in obedience to the pardon,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>for commanders, as being persons well qualified for
such employments, who made up their crews chiefly
of their scattered companions, who were newly
returned upon the hopes of preferment.</p>

<p class='c000'>About this time a fishing vessel, belonging to the
island of Providence, brought in the master of a ship
and a few sailors, whom she had picked up at sea
in a canoe. The said master was called Captain
King, who sailed in a ship called the Neptune, belonging
to South-Carolina, laden with rice, pitch,
tar, and other merchandise, bound for London.</p>

<p class='c000'>The account he gave of himself was, that he was
met with by Charles Vane, the pirate, who carried
him into Green Turtle Bay, one of the Bahama
islands, by whom he was plundered of a great part
of his cargo, which, consisting chiefly of stores, was
of great use to them; that afterwards they cut away
part of one of the masts of the ship, and fired a
gun down her hold, with intent to sink her; that
they took some of his men into their service, and
when they were sailing off, gave him and the rest
a canoe to save themselves; that with this canoe
they made shift to sail from one little island to another,
till they had the good luck to meet the fishing
boat which took them up; and that he believed
Charles Vane might still be cruising thereabouts.</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon this intelligence, the governor fitted out a
ship which was named the Willing Mind, manned
with 50 stout hands, well armed, and also a sloop
with 30 hands, which he sent to cruise among those
islands, in search of Vane, the pirate, giving them
orders also to endeavour to recover the ship Neptune,
which Capt. King told them had still goods of
considerable value left in her.</p>

<p class='c000'>They went out accordingly, but never saw Vane.
However, they found the Neptune, which was not
sunk as the pirates intended; for the ball they
fired into her stuck in the ballast, without passing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>through. They returned with her about the 10th of
November; but an unlucky accident happened to
the Willing Mind, occasioned either by the ignorance
or carelessness of the pilot, which bilged in
going over the bar.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the mean time Vane made towards the coast
of Hispaniola, living riotously on board, having an
abundance of liquor, and plenty of fresh provisions,
such as hogs, goats, sheep, and fowl, which he got
upon easy terms; for touching at a place called
Isleathera, he plundered the inhabitants of as much
of their provision as they could carry away. Here
they cruised to about February, when, near the
windward passage of Cape Mase, they met with a
large rich ship of London, called the Kingston, laden
with bale goods, and other rich merchandise, and
having several passengers on board, some English,
and some Jews, besides two women.</p>

<p class='c000'>Towards the north end of Jamaica, they also met
with a turtle sloop, bound in for that island, on board
of which (after having first plundered her) they
put the captain of the Kingston, some of his men,
and all the passengers except the two women,
whom they detained, contrary to their usual practice.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Kingston they kept for their own use; for
now their company being strengthened by a great
many recruits, some volunteers and some forced
men out of the Neptune and Kingston, they thought
they had hands enough for two ships. Accordingly
they shifted several of their hands on board the
Kingston, and John Rackham, alias Calico Jack, (so
called, because his jackets and drawers were always
made of calico) quarter-master to Vane, was unanimously
chosen captain of the Kingston.</p>

<p class='c000'>The empire of these pirates had not been long
thus divided before they had like to have fallen into
a civil war among themselves, which must have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>ended in the destruction of one of them. The fatal
occasion of the difference between these two brother
adventurers, was this. It happened that Vane’s
liquor was all out, who sending to his brother captain
for a supply, Rackham accordingly spared him
what he thought fit; but it falling short of Vane’s
expectation, as to quantity, he went on board of
Rackham’s ship to expostulate with him, so that
words arising, Rackham threatened to shoot him
through the head, if he did not immediately return
to his own ship; and told him likewise, that if he
did not sheer off, and part company, he would sink
him. Vane thought it best to take his advice, for
he thought the other was bold enough to be as good
as his word, for he had it in his power to be so, his
ship being the largest and strongest of the two.
Accordingly they parted, and Rackham made for
the island of Princes, and having great quantities
of rich goods on board, taken in the late prizes, they
were divided into lots, and he and his crew shared
them by throwing dice, the highest cast being to
choose first. When they had done, they packed up
their goods in casks, and buried them on shore in
the island of Princes, that they might have room for
fresh booty. In the mean time it happening that a
turtle sloop, belonging to Jamaica, came in there,
Rackham sent his boat and brought the master on
board of him, and asking him several questions, the
master informed him that war with Spain had been
proclaimed in Jamaica; and that the time appointed
by the general pardon for pirates to surrender, in
order to receive the benefit thereof, had not expired.</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon this intelligence Rackham and his crew suddenly
changed their minds, and were resolved to
take the benefit of the pardon by a speedy surrender;
wherefore, instead of using the master ill, as
the poor man expected, they made him several presents,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>desiring him to sail back to Jamaica, and acquaint
the governor they were willing to surrender,
provided he would give his word and honour they
should have the benefit of the pardon; which, extensive
as it was, they apprehended they were not
entitled to, because they had run away in defiance
of it at Providence. They desired the master also
to return with the governor’s answer, assuring him
he should be no loser by the voyage.</p>

<p class='c000'>The master very willingly undertook the commission,
and arriving at Jamaica, delivered his message
to the governor, according to his instructions; but
it happened that the master of the Kingston, with
his passengers, having arrived at Jamaica, had acquainted
the governor with the piracies of Vane and
Rackham, before the turtle got thither, who was
actually fitting out two sloops, which were now just
ready, in pursuit of them, so that the governor was
very glad to discover, by the turtler’s message,
where Rackham was to be found.</p>

<p class='c000'>The two sloops, well manned, accordingly sailed
out, and found Rackham in the station where the
turtler had described him, but altogether in disorder,
and quite unprepared, either for sailing or fighting,
most of his sails being on shore, erected into tents,
and his decks lumbered with goods. He happened
to be on board himself, though most of his men
were ashore, and seeing the two sloops at a distance,
bearing towards him, he observed them with his
glass, and fancied he saw on board something like
preparations for fighting. This was what he did
not expect, for he looked for no enemy, and while
he was in doubt and suspense about them, they came
so near that they began to fire.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had neither time nor means to prepare for defence,
so that there was nothing to be done but to
run into his boat, and escape to the shore, which he
did accordingly with the few hands he had with him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>leaving the two women on board to be taken by the
enemy.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sloops seized the Kingston, manned her, and
brought her into Jamaica, having still a great part
of her cargo left. When she arrived, the master of
her fell to examining what part of the cargo was
lost and what left; he searched also for his bills of
lading and cockets, but they were all destroyed by
Rackham; so that the ship being freighted by several
owners, the master could not tell whose property
was saved, and whose lost, till he had fresh bills of
parcels of each owner from England. There was
one remarkable piece of good luck which happened
in this affair; there were, amongst other goods,
sixty gold watches on board, and thirty of silver;
the pirates divided the silver watches, but the gold
being packed up amongst some bale goods, were
never discovered by them, and the master, in searching,
found them all safe.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the mean time, Rackham and his crew lived in
the woods, in very great suspense what to do with
themselves. They had with them ammunition and
small arms, and also some of the goods, such as
bales of silk stockings, and laced hats, with which,
it is supposed, they intended to make themselves
fine. They had also two boats and a canoe.</p>

<p class='c000'>Being divided in their resolutions, Rackham, with
six more, determined to take one of the boats, and
make the best of their way for the island of Providence,
and there claim the benefit of the king’s pardon,
which they fancied they might be entitled to,
by representing, that they were carried away by
Vane, against their wills. Accordingly they put
some arms, ammunition, and provision, into the best
boat, and also some of the goods, and set sail.
They first made the Island of Pines, from thence
got over to the north side of Cuba, where they destroyed
several Spanish boats and launches; one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>they took, which being a stout sea boat, they shifted
themselves and their cargo into her, sunk their own,
and then stretched over to the island of Providence,
where they landed safely about the middle of May,
1719, where demanding the king’s pardon, the governor
thought fit to allow it them, and certificates
were granted to them accordingly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here they sold their goods, and spent the money
merrily. When all was gone, some engaged themselves
in privateers, and others in trading vessels.
But Rackham, as captain, having a much larger
share than any of the rest, his money held out a
little longer; but happening about this time to form
a criminal acquaintance with one Ann Bonny, a
married woman, he became very extravagant, and
found it necessary, to avoid detection and punishment,
to abscond with his mistress.</p>

<p class='c000'>For this purpose they plotted together to seize a
sloop which then lay in the harbour, and Rackham
drew some brisk young fellows into the conspiracy.
They were of the number of the pirates lately pardoned,
and who, he knew, were weary of working
on shore, and longed to be again at their old trade.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sloop they made choice of was between 30
and 40 tons, and one of the swiftest sailers that ever
was built of that kind. She belonged to one John
Haman, who lived upon a little island not far from
Providence, which was inhabited by no human creature
except himself and his family. His livelihood
and constant employment was to plunder and pillage
the Spaniards, whose sloops and launches he had
often surprised about Cuba and Hispaniola, and
sometimes brought off a considerable booty, always
escaping by a good pair of heels, insomuch that it
became a bye-word to say, <em>there goes John Haman,
catch him if you can</em>. His business to Providence
now, was to bring his family there, in order to live
and settle, being weary, perhaps, of living in that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>solitude, or else apprehensive, if any of the Spaniards
should discover his habitation, they might
land, and be revenged on him for all his pranks.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ann Bonny was observed to go several times on
board this sloop. She pretended to have some business
with John Haman; but always went when he
was on shore, for her true errand was to discover
how many hands were on board, and what kind of
watch they kept, and to know the passages and
ways of the vessel.</p>

<p class='c000'>She discovered as much as was necessary. She
found there were but two hands on board, and that
John Haman slept on shore every night. She inquired
of them whether they watched; where they
lay; and many other questions; to all which they
readily answered her, as thinking she had no design
but common curiosity.</p>

<p class='c000'>She acquainted Rackham with every particular,
who resolved to lose no time, and therefore, acquainting
his associates, who were eight in number,
they appointed an hour for meeting at night, which
was 12 o’clock. They were all true to the roguery,
and Ann Bonny was as punctual as the most resolute,
and being all well armed, they took a boat and
rowed to the sloop, which was very near the shore.</p>

<p class='c000'>The night seemed to favour the attempt, for it
was both dark and rainy. As soon as they got on
board, Ann Bonny, having a drawn sword in one
hand, and a pistol in the other, attended by one of
the men, went straight to the cabin where the two
fellows lay who belonged to the sloop. The noise
awaked them, which she observing, declared that if
they pretended to resist, or make a noise, she would
blow their brains out.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the mean time, Rackham and the rest were
busy heaving in the cables, one of which they soon
got up, and for expedition sake, they slipped the
other, and so drove down the harbour. They passed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>pretty near the fort, which hailed them, as did also
the guard-ship, asking them where they were going?
They answered, their cable had parted, and
that they had nothing but a grappling on board,
which would not hold them; immediately after
which they set a small sail, just to give them steerage
way. When they came to the harbour’s mouth,
and thought they could not be seen by any of the
ships, on account of the darkness of the night, they
hoisted all the sail they had, and stood to sea; then
calling up the two men, they asked them if they
would be of their party; but finding them not inclined,
they gave them a boat to row themselves
ashore, ordering them to give their service to Haman,
and tell him they would send him his sloop
again when they had done with her.</p>

<p class='c000'>Rackham and his paramour both bore a great
spleen to Richard Turnley, who was gone from Providence,
turtling, before they made their escape,
and they knowing what island he was upon, made
to the place. They saw the sloop about a league
from the shore, and went on board with six hands;
but Turnley, with his boy, by good luck, happened
to be ashore salting some wild hogs they had killed
the day before. They inquired for him, and hearing
where he was, rowed ashore in search of him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Turnley, from the land, saw the sloop boarded,
and observed the men afterwards making for the
shore, and being apprehensive of pirates, which
were very common in those parts, he, with his boy,
fled into a neighbouring wood. The surf being very
great, so that they could not bring their boat to
shore, they waded up to the arm-pits, and Turnley,
peeping through the trees, saw them bring arms on
shore. Upon the whole, not liking their appearance,
he, with his boy, lay snug in the bushes.</p>

<p class='c000'>When they had looked about and could not see
him, they called him aloud by name; but he not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>appearing, they thought it time lost to look for him
in such a wilderness, and therefore returned to their
boat, but rowed again back to the sloop, and took
away the sails, and several other things. They
also carried away with them three of the hands,
viz. Richard Connor, the mate, John Davis, and
John Howel, but rejected David Soward, the fourth
hand, though he had been an old and experienced
pirate, because he was lame, and disabled by a
wound he had formerly received.</p>

<p class='c000'>When they had done thus much, they cut away
the mast, and towing the vessel into deep water,
sunk her, having first put David Soward into a boat
to shift for himself. He, however, got ashore, and
after some time, found Turnley.</p>

<p class='c000'>From thence, Rackham stretched over to the
Bury Islands, plundering all the sloops he met, and
strengthening his company with several additional
hands, and so went on till he was finally taken and
executed at Port Royal, Jamaica.</p>

<p class='c000'>About this time, the governor, in conjunction
with some factors then residing at Providence,
thought fit to freight some vessels for a trading
voyage. Accordingly the Bachelor’s Adventure, a
schooner, Capt. Henry White, commander; the
Lancaster, sloop, Capt. William Greenway, commander;
the May, sloop, Capt. John Augur, commander,
of which last David Soward was owner,
(she having been given him by some pirates his
former associates) in which he also sailed this voyage,
were fitted out with a cargo of goods and
merchandise, bound for Port Prince, on the island
of Cuba.</p>

<p class='c000'>The governor thought it advisable, for the benefit
of the inhabitants of Providence, to settle a correspondence
with some merchants of Port Prince, first
in order to procure fresh provisions, there being
scarce any upon the island at the governor’s first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>arrival, and there being at Port Prince great plenty
of cows and hogs, he proposed to get a sufficient
number of each, to stock the island for breed, that
the people for the future might have fresh provision
of their own.</p>

<p class='c000'>They set sail on Sunday, the 5th of October, 1718.
The next day they arrived at an island known by the
name of Green Key, lying S. S. E. from Providence,
in lat. 28 deg. 40 m. being distant about 25 leagues.
Here they cast anchor, in order to wait for morning
to carry them through some rocks and shoals which
lay in their way, and some hands went ashore to try
to kill something for supper before it should be dark.
They expected to meet some wild hogs, for some
time before, one Joseph Bay and one Sims, put two
sows and a boar on said island; for they living at
that time at Providence, and being continually visited
by pirates, were always plundered of their
fresh provisions, wherefore they thought of settling
a breed upon Green Key, that they might have recourse
to in time of necessity.</p>

<p class='c000'>This island is about nine miles in circumference,
and about three miles broad in the widest place. It
is overgrown with wild cabbage and Palmata trees,
and has a great variety of other herbs and fruits, so
that there is plenty of food for the nourishment of
such animals; but the trees growing so close together,
makes it bad hunting, and they killed but
one hog, which, however, was of a monstrous size.</p>

<p class='c000'>The hunters returned on board their ships again
before seven, having first divided the hog, and sent
part on board each vessel for supper that night.
After supper, Capt. Greenway and Capt. White
came on board of Capt. Augur’s sloop, in order to
consult together what time to sail, and being all
of opinion that if they weighed anchor between the
hours of 10 and 11, it would be day before they
would come up with the shoals, they agreed upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>that hour for setting sail, and so returned to their
own vessels.</p>

<p class='c000'>Soon after, Phinehas Bunch, and Dennis Mackarthy,
with a great many others, came from White’s
sloop, on board of Augur’s. Their pretence was,
that they came to see Richard Turnley and Mr.
James Carr, who had formerly been a midshipman
on the Rose man of war, under Capt. Whitney, and
being a great favourite of Governor Rogers, he had
appointed him supercargo of this voyage. They
desired to be treated with a bottle of beer, for they
knew Mr. Carr had some that was very good in his
care, which had been put on board, in order to
make presents of, and to treat the Spanish merchants
with.</p>

<p class='c000'>As it was not suspected they had any thing
else in view, Mr. Carr readily went down, and
brought up a couple of bottles of beer. They sat
upon the poop with Capt. Augur in their company,
and were drinking their beer; before the second
bottle was out, Bunch and Mackarthy began to rattle,
talk with great pleasure, and much boasting of
their former exploits when they had been pirates,
crying up a pirate’s life to be the only life for a man
of any spirit. While they were running on in this
manner, Bunch on a sudden started up, and swore
he would be captain of that vessel. Augur answered
him the vessel did not want a captain, for he was
able to command her himself, which seemed to put
an end to the discourse for that time.</p>

<p class='c000'>Soon after Bunch began to tell what bright arms
they had on board their sloop; upon which, one of
Augur’s men handed up some of their cutlasses
which had been cleaned that day. Among them
was Mr. Carr’s silver-hilted sword. Bunch seemed
to admire the sword, and asked whose it was? Mr.
Carr made answer, it belonged to him. Bunch replied
it was a very handsome one, and drawing it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>out, marched about the poop, flourishing it over his
head, and telling Mr. Carr he would return it to him
when he had done with it. At the same time he
began to vapour again, and to boast of his former
piracies, and coming near Mr. Carr, struck him with
the sword. Turnley bid him take care what he did,
for Mr. Carr would not take such usage. As they
were disputing upon this matter, Dennis Mackarthy
stole off, and, with some of his associates, seized
upon the great cabin, where all the arms lay. At
the same time several of the men began to sing a
song with these words. <em>Did you not promise me,
that you would marry me</em>—which it seems was the
signal agreed upon among the conspirators for
seizing the ship. Bunch no sooner heard them, but
he cried out aloud, <em>that I will for I am parson</em>,
and struck Mr. Carr again several blows with his
own sword. Mr. Carr and Turnley both seized him,
and they began to struggle, when Dennis Mackarthy,
with several others, returned from the cabin
with each a cutlass in one hand, and a loaded pistol
in the other, and running up to them, said, <em>What!
do the governor’s dogs offer to resist?</em> And beating
Turnley and Carr with their cutlasses, threatened
to shoot them, at the same time firing their pistols
close to their cheeks, upon which Turnley and Carr
begged their lives.</p>

<p class='c000'>When they were thus in possession of the vessel,
they hailed Capt. Greenway, and desired him to
come on board about urgent business. He, knowing
nothing of what had passed, jumped into his boat,
and with two hands only, rowed on board. Dennis
Mackarthy led him into the cabin, and, as soon as
he was there, laid hold of him, telling him he was
now a prisoner, and must submit. He offered to
make some resistance; upon which, they told him
all resistance would be vain, for his own men were
in the plot; and, indeed, seeing the two hands who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>rowed him aboard, now armed, and joining with the
conspirators, he thought it was time to submit.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as this was done, they sent some hands
on board to seize his sloop, or rather to acquaint his
men with what had been done, for they expected
to meet with no resistance, many of them being in
the plot, and the rest, they supposed, not very
averse to it; after which, they decoyed Captain
White on board, by the same stratagem they used
with Greenway, and likewise sent on board his sloop,
and found his men, one and all, well disposed for the
design; and what was most remarkable was, that
Captain Augur, seeing how things were going,
joined with them, showing himself as well inclined
for pirating as the worst of them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus they made themselves masters of the three
vessels with very little trouble. The next thing to
be done was to resolve how to dispose of those who
were not of their party. Some were for killing
Richard Turnley, but the majority carried it for
marooning, that he might be starved, and die like a
dog, as they called it. Their great spleen to him
was, because he was the person who had piloted the
governor into Providence.</p>

<p class='c000'>Accordingly, Turnley, with John Carr, Thomas
Rich, and some others, were stripped naked, and
tumbled over the vessel’s side into a boat which lay
along side. The oars were all taken out, and they
left them nothing to work themselves ashore with
but an old paddle, which, at other times, served to
steer the boat, and so they commanded them to be
gone. However, they made shift to get safe ashore
on the island, which, as we observed before, was
quite uninhabited.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next morning Dennis Mackarthy, with several
others, went on shore, and told them they must
come on board again, and they would give them
some clothes to put on. They fancied the pirates
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>began to repent of the hard usage they had given
them, and were willing to return upon such an errand;
but when they got on board again, they found
their opinion of the pirates’ good nature was very ill
grounded, for they began with beating them, and
did it as if it were in sport, one having a boatswain’s
pipe, the rest beating them till he piped <em>belay</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The true design of bringing them on board again,
was to make them discover where some things lay,
which they could not readily find, particularly Mr.
Carr’s watch and silver snuff-box; but he was soon
obliged to inform them in what corner of the cabin
they were, and there they were found, with some
journals and other books, which they knew how to
make no other use of than turning them into cartridges.
Then they began to question Thomas Rich
about a gold watch which had once been seen in his
possession on shore at Providence; but he protested
that it belonged to Capt. Gale, who was commander
of the guard-ship called the Delicia, to which he
then belonged; but his protestations would have
availed him little, had it not been that some on
board, who belonged also to the Delicia, knew it to
be true, which put an end to his beating; and so
they were all discharged from their punishment for
the present.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some time after, fancying the pirates to be in better
humour, they begged for something to eat, for
they had none of them had any nourishment that
day or the night before; but all the answer they
received was, that such dogs should not ask such
questions. In the mean time, some of the pirates
were very busy endeavouring to persuade Captain
Greenway to engage with them, for they knew him
to be an excellent artist; but he was obstinate and
would not. Then it was proposed to maroon him,
which was opposed by some, because he was a Bermudian,
meaning, that he might perhaps swim away,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>or swim on board his vessel again, for the Bermudians
are all excellent swimmers; but as he represented,
that he could not hurt them by his swimming,
he obtained the favour for himself and the
other officers, to be set ashore with Turnley, Carr,
and Rich. Accordingly, they were put into the
same boat without oars, to the number of eight,
and were ordered to make the best of their way on
shore.</p>

<p class='c000'>The pirates, the next day, having examined all
their vessels, and finding that Greenway’s sloop was
not fit for their purpose, shifted every thing out of
her. Those that were sent on shore could see from
thence what they were doing, and when they saw
them row off, Greenway swam on board the sloop,
it is likely, to see whether they had left any thing
behind them. They perceived him, and fancied he
repented refusing to join with them, and had come
to do it now; wherefore some of them returned
back to the sloop, to speak to him, but they found
him of the same opinion he was in before. However,
he wheedled them into so much good humour,
that they told him he might have his sloop again, in
which, indeed, they had left nothing except an old
mainsail, an old fore-sail, four small pieces of Irish
beef, in an old beef barrel, and about twenty biscuits,
with a broken bucket which was used to draw
water in, telling him that he and the rest must not
go on board till they had sailed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Greenway swam ashore again to give notice to
his brothers in distress, of what had passed. The
same afternoon Bunch with several others went on
shore, carrying with them six bottles of wine and
some biscuits. Whether this was done to tempt
Greenway again, or no, is hard to say; for though
they talked to him a great deal, they drank all the
wine themselves to the last bottle, and then gave
each of the poor creatures a glass a-piece, with a bit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>of biscuit, and immediately after fell to beating them,
and so went on board.</p>

<p class='c000'>While they were on shore, there came in a turtler
which belonged to one Thomas Bennet, of Providence,
whereof one Benjamin Hutchins was master.
They soon laid hold of her, for she sailed
excellently well. Hutchins was reputed an extraordinary
good pilot among those islands; wherefore
they tempted him to engage with them; at first he
refused, but rather than be marooned, he afterwards
consented.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was now the 9th of October, and they were just
preparing to sail, when they sent on shore, ordering
the <em>condemned malefactors</em> to come on board Greenway’s
sloop, the Lancaster. They did so in the little
boat they went on shore in, by the help of the
same paddle. They found several of the pirates
there, who told them that they gave them that sloop
to return to Providence, though they let them have
no more stores, than what were named before. They
bade them take the fore-sail, and bend it for a jib,
and furl it close down to the bowsprit, and to furl
the mainsail close up to the boom. They did as
they were ordered, for they knew there was no disputing
whether it was right or wrong.</p>

<p class='c000'>Soon after, another detachment came on board,
among whom were Bunch and Dennis Mackarthy,
who being either mad or drunk, fell upon them,
beating them, and cutting the rigging and sails to
pieces with their cutlasses, and commanding them
not to sail, till they should hear from them again,
threatening if they did, they would put them all to
death, if ever they met them again; and so they
went off, carrying with them the boat, which they
sent them first ashore in, and sailed away.</p>

<p class='c000'>They left them in this miserable condition, without
tackle to go their voyage, and without a boat to
get on shore, and having nothing in view but to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>perish for want; but as self preservation put them
upon exerting themselves, in order to get out of this
deplorable state, they began to rummage and search
the vessel through every hole and corner, to see if
nothing was left which might be of use to them;
and it happened by chance that they found an old
hatchet, with which they cut some sticks sharp to
serve for marling-spikes. They also cut out several
other things, to serve instead of such tools as are
absolutely necessary on board a ship.</p>

<p class='c000'>When they had proceeded thus far, every man
began to work as hard as he could; they cut a piece
of cable, which they strung into rope yarns, and fell
to mending their sails with all possible expedition;
they also made a kind of fishing lines of rope yarns,
and bent some nails crooked to serve for hooks; but
as they were destitute of a boat, as well for the use
of fishing as for going on shore, they resolved to
make a bark log, that is, to lay two or three logs
together, and lash them close, upon which two or
three men may sit very safely in smooth water.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as this was done, some hands went on
shore, upon one of the logs (for they made two of
them) who employed themselves in cutting wild
cabbage, gathering berries, and a fruit which the
seamen call prickly pears, for food, while some
others went a fishing upon another. Those who
went ashore also carried the old bucket with them,
so that whilst some were busy in gathering things
to serve for provision, one hand was constantly
employed in bringing fresh water aboard in the
bucket, which was tedious work, considering how
little could be brought at a time, and that the sloop
lay near a mile from the shore.</p>

<p class='c000'>When they had employed themselves thus, for
about four or five days, they brought their sails and
tackle into such order, having also a little water,
cabbage and other things on board, that they thought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>it was time to venture to sail. Accordingly they
weighed their anchor, and setting all the sail they
had, got out to the harbour’s mouth, when to their
great terror and surprise, they saw the pirates coming
in again.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were much frightened at this unexpected
return, because of the threatenings they had used
to them at parting, not to sail without further orders;
wherefore, they tacked about, and ran as close
in to the shore as they could, then throwing out their
bark logs, they all put themselves upon them, and
made to land, as fast as they could; but before they
quite reached it, the pirates got so near that they
fired at them, but were too far to do execution.
However, they pursued them ashore; the unhappy
exiles immediately took to the woods, and for greater
security climbed up some trees, whose branches
were very thick, and by that means concealed themselves.
The pirates not finding them, soon returned
to their boat, and rowed on board the deserted sloop,
whose mast and bowsprit they cut away, and towing
into deep water, sunk her; after which, they
made again for shore, thinking that the fugitives
would have been out of their lurking holes, and that
they should surprise them; but they continued still
on the tops of the trees and saw all that passed, and
therefore thought it safest to keep their posts.</p>

<p class='c000'>The pirates not finding them, returned to their
vessels, and weighing their anchors, set sail, steering
eastward. In the mean time, the poor fellows
were in despair, for seeing their vessel sunk, they
had scarce any hopes left of escaping the danger of
perishing upon that uninhabited island, where they
lived eight days, feeding upon berries, and shell-fish,
such as cockles and periwinkles, sometimes catching
a stingray, a fish resembling mead or thornback,
which coming into shoal water, they could wade
near them, and by the help of a stick sharpened at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>the end, which they did by rubbing it against the
rocks, (for they had not a knife left among them)
they stuck them as if it had been with a spear.</p>

<p class='c000'>It must be observed, that they had no means of
striking a fire, and therefore their way of dressing
this fish was, by dipping it in salt water, then laying
it in the sun, till it became both hard and dry, and
then they ate it.</p>

<p class='c000'>After passing eight days in this manner, the pirates
returned, and saw the poor fugitives ashore, who according
to custom made to the woods; but their
hearts began to relent towards them, and sending
ashore, they ordered a man to go into the woods
single, to call out to them, and promise them upon
their honour, if they would appear, that they would
give them victuals and drink, and not use them ill
any more.</p>

<p class='c000'>These promises, and the hunger which pinched
them, tempted them to come forth, and accordingly
they went on board, and they were as good as their
word, for they gave them as much beef and biscuit
as they could eat, during two or three days they
were on board, but would not give them a bit to
carry on shore.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was on board one George Redding, an inhabitant
of Providence, who was taken out of the
turtle sloop, and who was a forced man. Being an
acquaintance of Richard Turnley, and knowing that
he was resolved to go shore again, rather than engage
with the pirates, and hearing him say, that
they could find food to keep them alive, if they had
but fire to dress it, privately gave him a tinder box,
with materials in it for striking fire, which, in his circumstances,
was a greater present than gold or
jewels. Soon after, the pirates put the question
to them, whether they would engage, or be put
ashore? And they all agreed upon the latter: upon
which a debate arose among the pirates, whether
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>they should comply with their request or not; and
at length it was agreed, that Greenway and the
other two masters should be kept whether they
would or no; and the rest, being five in number,
should, as the pirates expressed it, have a second
refreshment on the varieties of the island.</p>

<p class='c000'>Accordingly Richard Turnley, James Carr, Thomas
Rich, John Cox, and John Taylor, were a
second time marooned, and the pirates, as soon as
they landed them, sailed off, steering eastward, till
they came to an island called Pudden Point, near
Long-Island, in lat. 24 degrees, where they cleaned
their vessels.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the mean time, Turnley and his companions
made a much better shift than they had done before,
his friend Redding’s present being of infinite use to
them, for they constantly kept a good fire, with
which they broiled their fish. There were plenty
of land crabs and snakes on the island, which they
could eat when they were dressed. Thus they
passed fourteen days; at the end of which the
pirates made them another visit, and they according
to custom made for the woods, thinking that the
reason of their return must be, in order to force
them to serve amongst them. But here they were
mistaken, for the anger of these fellows being over,
they began to pity them; but going ashore, and
not finding them, they knew they were hid for
fear. Nevertheless, they left upon the shore, where
they knew they would come, some stores which
they intended in this fit of good humour to present
them with.</p>

<p class='c000'>The poor islanders had got to their retreat, the
tops of the trees, and saw the pirates go off; upon
which they ventured down, and going to the water
side, were agreeably surprised to find a small cask
of flour, of between twenty and thirty pounds, about
a bushel of salt, two bottles of gun powder, several
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>bullets, besides a quantity of small shot, with a
couple of muskets, a very good axe, and also a pot
and a pan, and three dogs, which they took in the
turtle sloop; which dogs are bred to hunting, and
generally the sloops which go turtling, carry some
of them, as they are very useful in tracing out the
wild hogs. Besides all these, there were a dozen
horn handled knives, of that sort which are usually
carried to Guinea.</p>

<p class='c000'>They carried all things into the woods, to that
part where they had their fresh water, and where
they usually kept, and immediately went to work
with their axe; some cutting down bows, and making
poles, so that four of them were employed in
building a hut, while Richard Turnley taking the
dogs and a gun, went a hunting, he understanding
that sport very well. He had not been gone long
before he killed a large boar, which he brought
home to his companions, who fell to cutting it up,
and some they dressed for their dinner, and the rest
they salted, for another time.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus they lived, as they thought, very happy in
respect to their former condition; but after a few
days, the pirates made them another visit, for they
wanted to fill some casks with water. It happened
when they came in, that Turnley was gone a hunting,
and the rest all busy at work, so that they did
not see them, till they came into the wood upon
them. Seeing the hut, one of them in wantonness
set it on fire, and it was burnt to the ground; and
they appeared inclined to do mischief, when Richard
Turnley, knowing nothing of the matter, happened
to return from hunting, with a fine hog upon his
back, as much as he could carry. He was immediately
surrounded by the pirates, who seized upon
the fresh meat, which seemed to put them into better
humour. They made Richard Cox carry it down
to their boat, and when he had done, they gave him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>a bottle of rum to carry back to his companions to
drink their healths, telling him, that they might get
home if they could, or if they stayed there, they
would never trouble them any more.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were, indeed as good as their word, for
sailing away immediately, they made for Long-Island,
and coming up toward the salt ponds there
they saw at a distance in the harbour, three vessels
at an anchor, and supposing them to be either Bermuda
or New-York sloops, lying there to take in
salt, they bore down upon them with all the sail
they could make, expecting a good booty. The turtle
sloop taken from Benjamin Hutchins, was by much
the best sailer; however, it was almost dark before
she came up with them, and then coming close
along side of one of them, she gave a broadside, with
a design to board the next minute, but received
such a volley of small shot in return, as killed and
wounded a great many of the pirates, and the rest,
in great surprise and fright, jumped overboard, to
save themselves by swimming ashore.</p>

<p class='c000'>The truth is, these sloops proved to be Spanish privateers,
who observing the pirates to bear down upon
them, prepared themselves for action. The commander
in chief of these three privateers was one
who was called by the name of Turn Joe, because he
had once privateered on the English side. He had also
been a pirate, and now acted by virtue of a commission
from a Spanish governor. He was by birth an
Irishman, a bold enterprising fellow, and was afterwards
killed in an engagement with one John Bonnavee,
captain of a privateer belonging to Jamaica.</p>

<p class='c000'>But to return to our story. The sloop was taken,
and on board her was found, desperately wounded,
Phineas Bunch, who was the captain. By and by a
second of the pirate sloops came up; she heard the
volley, and supposed it to be fired by Bunch, when he
boarded one of the sloops; she came also along side
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>of one of the Spaniards, and received the welcome
that was given to Bunch, and submitted as soon. A
little after, came up the third, which was taken with
the same ease, and in the same manner, as many
of the pirates as could swim, jumping overboard to
save themselves on shore, there not being a man lost
on the side of the Spaniards.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next day Turn Joe asked them many questions,
and finding out that several amongst them had been
forced men, he with the consent of the other Spanish
officers, ordered all the goods to be taken out of
a Spanish launch, and putting some of the wounded
pirates into the said launch, with some provision,
water, and other liquors, gave it to the forced men,
to carry them to Providence.</p>

<p class='c000'>Accordingly George Redding, Thomas Betty,
Matthew Betty, and Benjamin Hutchins, with some
others, set sail, and in eight-and-forty hours arrived
in the harbour of Providence. They went on shore
immediately, and acquainted the governor with
every thing that had passed, from the time of their
setting out; informing him, that Phineas Bunch,
who was one of the chief authors of all the mischief,
was on board the launch. The governor, with
some others, went and examined him, and he confessed
all, wherefore there was no occasion for a
trial; and as he had been pardoned before, and it
was necessary to make some speedy example, it
was resolved that he should be executed the next
day, but it was prevented by his dying that night of
his wounds.</p>

<p class='c000'>They also informed the governor of the condition
of Turnley, Carr, and the rest, who were marooned
by the pirates upon Green Key Island; upon which
the governor sent for one John Sims, a mulatto man,
who had a two-mast boat in the harbour of Providence,
very fit for sailing; and putting some provisions
into her, ordered him to get five or six hands,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>and to sail for Green Key, in order to bring off the
five men there marooned.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sims accordingly made the best of his way, and
sailing out in the morning, arrived at Green Key
the next day towards evening. The poor people
on shore saw them, and supposing them to be some
of the pirates returned, thought it best to take to
the woods and hide, not knowing what humour
they might be in now. Sims and his ship-mates
carried some provision on shore, not knowing but
they might want, and searched about, calling out to
them by their names. After wandering about some
time, they came to the place where the fire was
constantly kept; on perceiving which, they fancied
they must be thereabouts, and that it would be best
to wait for them there, and accordingly they sat
down, laying the provisions near them. Turnley,
who had climbed to the top of a tree just by, saw
them, and observed their motions, and fancied they
were no enemies who were bringing them provisions,
and looking more earnestly, he knew Sims,
the mulatto, whom he was very well acquainted
with at Providence; upon which he called him, who
desired him to come down, telling him the comfortable
news, that he was come to the relief of him
and his companions. Turnley made what haste he
could to the bottom, and as soon as he was down,
summoned his comrades, who had climbed to the
top of some neighbouring trees, being in haste to
communicate the glad tidings to them. Being all
together, the mulatto related to them the history
of what had happened to the pirates.</p>

<p class='c000'>That night they supped comfortably together
upon the provision brought ashore; but so strange
an effect has joy, that scarce one of them slept a
wink that night, as they declared. The next day
they agreed to go a hunting, in order to get something
fresh to carry off with them, and were so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>successful, that they killed three fine hogs. When
they returned, they made the best of their way on
board, carrying with them all their utensils, and set
sail for Providence, whither they arrived in three
days; it being now just seven weeks from the time
of their being first set on shore by the pirates.</p>

<p class='c000'>The governor, in the mean time, was fitting out a
sloop to send to Long-Island, in order to take those
pirates who had saved themselves near the salt
ponds there, which sloop was now ready to sail, and
put under the command of Benjamin Hornygold.
Turnley and his companions embarked on board of
her, and care was taken to get as many men as
they could, who were entire strangers to the pirates.</p>

<p class='c000'>When they arrived at the said island, they run in
pretty near the shore, keeping but few hands on
deck, that it might look like a trading vessel, and
those men that were quite unknown to the pirates.</p>

<p class='c000'>The pirates seeing them, came only two or three
of them near the shore, the rest lying in ambush,
not without hopes of finding an opportunity to seize
the sloop, which sent her boat out towards the
shore, with orders to lay off at a little distance, as if
she was afraid. Those in ambush seeing the boat
so near, had not patience to stay any longer, but
flocked to the water side, calling out to them to
come on shore, and help them, for they were poor
shipwrecked men, perishing for want. Upon which
the boat rowed back again to the sloop.</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon second thoughts they sent her off again
with two bottles of wine, a bottle of rum, and some
biscuit, and sent another man, who was a stranger
to those ashore, with orders to pass for master of
the vessel. As soon as they approached them, the
pirates called to them as before, begging them, for
God’s sake to come on shore; they did so, and gave
them the biscuit, wine, and rum, which he said he
brought ashore on purpose to comfort them, because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>his men told him they were cast away. They were
very inquisitive to know where he was bound. He
told them, to New-York, and that he came in there
to take in salt. They earnestly entreated him to
take them on board, and carry them as passengers
to New-York; they being about sixteen in number,
he answered, he was afraid he had not provision
sufficient for so great a number; but that he would
go on board and overhaul his provision, and if they
pleased, some of them might go with him, and see
how his stock stood; that at least he would carry
some of them, and leave some refreshment for the
rest, till they could be succoured another way, but
that he hoped they would make him some recompense
when they should arrive at New-York.</p>

<p class='c000'>They seemed wonderfully pleased with his proposal,
and promised to make him ample satisfaction
for all the charges he should be at, pretending to
have good friends and considerable effects in different
parts of America. Accordingly he took several
of them with him in the boat, and as soon as
they got on board he invited them into the cabin,
where, to their surprise, they saw Benjamin Hornygold,
formerly a brother pirate; but what astonished
them more, was to see Richard Turnley, whom they
had lately marooned upon Green Key. They were
immediately surrounded by several with pistols in
their hands, and clapped in irons.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as this was over, the boat went on shore
again, and those in the boat told the pirates, that the
captain would venture to carry them with what provision
he had; at which they appeared much rejoiced,
and so the rest were brought on board, and
without much trouble clapped in irons, as well as
their companions.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sloop had nothing more to do, and therefore
set sail, and reaching Providence, delivered the pirates
all prisoners into the fort. A Court of Admiralty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>was immediately called, and they were all
tried, and nine received sentence of death, viz
John Augur, William Cunningham, Dennis Mackarthy,
William Dowling, William Lewis, Thomas Morris,
George Bendall, William Ling, and George
Rounsivel, which last was finally reprieved and pardoned.
The other seven were acquitted, it appearing
that they were forced.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following is the sentence pronounced upon
the prisoners:—</p>

<p class='c010'>THE COURT having duly considered of the evidence
which hath been given both for and against
you the said John Augur, William Cunningham,
Dennis Mackarthy, William Dowling, William Lewis,
Thomas Morris, George Bendall, William Ling,
and George Rounsivel; and having also debated the
several circumstances of the cases, it is adjudged,
that you the said John Augur, William Cunningham,
Dennis Mackarthy, William Dowling, William Lewis,
Thomas Morris, George Bendall, William Ling,
and George Rounsivel, are guilty of the mutiny,
felony, and piracy, wherewith you and every of you
stand accused. And the Court doth accordingly
pass sentence, that you the said John Augur, William
Cunningham, Dennis Mackarthy, William Dowling,
William Lewis, Thomas Morris, George Bendall,
William Ling, and George Rounsivel, be carried
to prison from whence you came, and from
thence to the place of execution, where you are to
be hanged by the neck till you shall be <em>dead, dead,
dead</em>; and God have mercy on your souls. Given
under our hands this 10th day of December, A. D.
1718. (Signed)</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>After sentence was passed upon the prisoners,
the governor, as president of the court, appointed
their execution to be on Friday next, the 12th inst.
at 10 o’clock in the morning.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whereupon the prisoners prayed for longer time
to repent and prepare for death; but the governor
told them, that from the time of their being apprehended,
they ought to have accounted themselves
as condemned by the laws of all nations, which was
only sealed now, and that the securing them hitherto,
and the favour that the Court had allowed them
in making as long a defence as they could, wholly
took up that time which the affairs of the settlement
required in working at the fortifications; besides
the fatigue thereby occasioned to the whole
garrison in the necessary guards, set over them by
the want of a gaol, and the garrison having been
very much reduced by sickness and death since his
arrival; also, that he was obliged to employ all his
people to assist in mounting the great guns, and in
finishing the present works, with all possible despatch,
on account of the expected war with Spain;
and there being many more pirates amongst these
islands, and this place left destitute of all relief from
any man of war or station ship, joined to other reasons,
too long to enumerate in court, he thought
himself indispensably obliged, for the welfare of
the settlement, to give them no longer time.</p>

<p class='c000'>The prisoners were then ordered to the place of
their imprisonment in the fort, where leave was
given them to send for any persons to read and
pray with them.</p>

<p class='c000'>On Friday morning each of the prisoners was
called in private, to know if they had any load upon
their spirits, for actions committed as yet unknown
to the world, the declaring of which was absolutely
required to prepare themselves for a fit repentance;
but they each refused to declare any thing, as well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>as making known to the governor, if they knew of
any conspiracy against the government.</p>

<p class='c000'>Wherefore, about 10 o’clock, the prisoners were
released from their irons, and committed to the
charge and care of Thomas Robinson, Esq. commissioned
Provost Marshal for the day, who, according
to custom in such cases, pinioned them, &amp;c. and
ordered the guards appointed to assist him, to lead
them to the top of the rampart, fronting the sea,
which was well guarded by the governor’s soldiers
and people, to the number of about 100. At the
prisoners’ request, several select prayers and psalms
were read, in which all present joined. When the
service was ended, orders were given to the Marshal,
and he conducted the prisoners down a ladder,
provided on purpose, to the foot of the wall, where
a gallows was erected, and a black flag hoisted
thereon, and under it a stage, supported by three
butts, on which they ascended by another ladder,
where the hangman fastened the cords. They had
three-quarters of an hour allowed under the gallows,
which was spent by them in singing psalms,
and some exhortations to their old consorts, and the
other spectators, who got as near to the foot of the
gallows as the marshal’s guard would suffer them.
When the marshal was ordered to make ready, and
all the prisoners expected the launch, the governor
thought fit to order George Rounsivel to be untied,
and when brought off the stage, the butts having
ropes about them, were hauled away; upon which,
the stage fell, and the prisoners were suspended.</p>

<h4 id='EXECUTED' class='c012'><em>A Short Account of the Prisoners Executed.</em></h4>

<p class='c008'>First, John Augur, being about 40 years of age,
had been a noted shipmaster at Jamaica, and since
among the pirates; but on his accepting of His Majesty’s
act of grace, and recommendations to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>governor, he was, notwithstanding, entrusted with
a good vessel and cargo, in which, betraying his
trust, and knowing himself guilty of the indictment,
he all along appeared very penitent, and neither
washed, shaved, or shifted his old clothes, when carried
to be executed; and when he had a small glass
of wine given him on the rampart, drank it with
wishes for the good success of the Bahama Islands,
and the governor.</p>

<p class='c000'>The second, William Cunningham, aged 45, had
been gunner with Thatch, the pirate, who, being
also conscious of his own guilt, was seemingly penitent,
and behaved himself as such.</p>

<p class='c000'>The third, Dennis Mackarthy, aged 28, had also
been formerly a pirate, but accepted of the king’s
act of grace; and the governor had made him an
ensign of the militia, being recommended as a sober,
discreet person, which commission he had at the
time of his joining the pirates, which very much
aggravated his other crimes. During his imprisonment,
he behaved himself tolerably well; but when
he thought he was to die, and the morning came,
without his expected reprieve, he shifted his clothes,
and wore long blue ribands at his neck, wrists,
knees, and cap; and when on the rampart, looked
cheerfully round him, saying, <em>He knew the time
when there were many brave fellows on the island,
who would not have suffered him to die like a dog</em>;
and at the same time pulled off his shoes, kicking
them over the parapet of the fort, saying, <em>He had
promised not to die with his shoes on</em>; so descended
the fort wall, and ascended the stage, with the agility
and address of a prize-fighter. When mounted,
he exhorted the people, who were at the foot of the
walls, to have compassion on him; but, however
willing, they saw too much power over their heads
to attempt any thing in his favour.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>The fourth, William Dowling, about 24 years of
age, had been a considerable time among the pirates,
of a wicked life, which His Majesty’s act of
grace did not reform. His behaviour was very loose
on the stage, and after his death, some of his acquaintance
declared, he had confessed to them, that
he had murdered his mother before he left Ireland.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fifth, William Lewis, aged about 34 years, as
he had been a hardy pirate and prize-fighter, affected
an unconcern at death; but heartily desired liquors
to drink with his fellow-sufferers on the stage, and
with the standers by.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sixth, Thomas Morris, aged about 22, had
been a very incorrigible youth and pirate, and
seemed to have very little anxiety of mind by his
frequent smiles when at the bar. Being dressed
with red ribands, as Mackarthy was with blue, he
said, going over the ramparts, <em>We have a new governor,
but a harsh one</em>; and a little before he was
turned off, said aloud, <em>he might have been a greater
plague to these islands, and now he wished he had
been so</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The seventh, George Bendall, aged 18, though
he said, <em>he had never been a pirate before, yet he had
all the villanous inclinations the most profligate
youth could be infected with</em>. His behaviour was
sullen.</p>

<p class='c000'>The eighth, William Ling, aged about 30, not
taken notice of before the last attempt, behaved
himself as became a true penitent, and was not
heard to say any thing besides replying to Lewis,
when he demanded wine to drink, <em>that water was
more suitable to them at that time</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was observed that there were but few (besides
the governor’s adherents) among the spectators,
who had not deserved the same fate, but pardoned
by His Majesty’s act of grace.</p>

</div>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>The public mind has been much agitated by the
depredations of these enemies of all laws, human
and divine. It is strange, that in this enlightened
age, when the principles of civil liberty are so well
understood, and when the doctrines of the rights of
man are gaining so many adherents both in this
country and in Europe, that there should be found
men so lost to every good principle, as to pursue
such a predatory warfare against defenceless people;
and with the slightest pretext, butcher those
unfortunate fellow creatures who may fall in their
way. And it is no less astonishing, as piracy does
exist, that all civilized governments have not combined
to suppress this horrid practice, and teach
these refractory and deluded men, that the arm of
justice is not shortened, nor the rulers of the earth
asleep.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our government has taken a forward step to arrest
these free-booters in their blood-thirsty projects,
and no doubt the expedition which was under
the command of that gallant officer, Commodore
Porter, has done much towards putting down this
nefarious practice in the West-India seas.</p>

<h3 id='KATE' class='c007'>MUTINY ON BOARD THE BRITISH SHIP KATE.</h3>

<p class='c008'>The crew, 8 in number, of the ship Kate, Captain
Purdy, landed in the island of Guadaloupe, on the
24th of January, 1821. They slept on the beach
that night, and next morning a planter in the neighbourhood
came to them, and brought them to his
house. Their story was uniform, all said they belonged
to the American ship Retrieve, Capt. Jacob
Hawes, belonging to Messrs. Suydam &amp; Wyckoff,
merchants, of New-York; that after 6 weeks boisterous
weather, not being able to keep the ship
free, she being very leaky, the Captain had given
orders to get the boat in readiness, and that they
were doing it, and getting into the boat about 10
o’clock at night, when the Captain’s son, about 10
years old, fell overboard in trying to get into the
boat, and that the Captain threw himself into the
sea to save him, but both perished, and the ship
went down; that after one night and two days in
the boat, they reached the beach near the Mole,
with great hazard of their lives.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were afterwards escorted to Point Petre,
where they were examined by the Judge, and persisted
in the same story; except one French lad,
who privately disclosed the truth to the attorney
general.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>They had with them all their baggage, and considerable
money. Among the baggage was a Bible,
with the label, “Presented by the Merchants’ Seamen
Auxiliary Bible Society, to the ship Kate, of
London—Gravesend, 11th May, 1818.” This, the
mate, Thomas Murdock, said was given to him by a
fellow lodger in New-York. The Judge, however,
availed himself of this circumstance to interrogate
them a second time. Calling on Murdock, he said—“There
is the Bible belonging to the ship Kate, of
London, Capt. George Purdy, and upon that very
same Bible you swear to tell the truth, and nothing
but the truth.” Murdock, much embarrassed, said
in broken words, that he was not accustomed to
swear on the Bible, and resisted some time, when
the Judge observed to him, that if he would not answer
to the questions, he would pronounce him guilty
immediately; for to refuse answering the questions
of the Court was declaring himself guilty. Murdock
then kissed the Bible. “Since I have taken an oath,
(said he,) on the Bible, I will speak the truth,” and
related the real story, in substance—</p>

<p class='c000'>“That they belonged to the ship Kate, of London,
Capt. George Purdy, which ship had been chartered
in August last, at Halifax, for a voyage to Berbice
and back to Halifax. The ship took a cargo of fish,
beef, and some lumber. They reached Berbice,
where the cargo was sold for cash. The proceeds
were put on board in two boxes iron hooped, containing
5600 dollars. The ship sailed for Halifax in
ballast. The mate had been discharged at Berbice,
after having some quarrel with the Captain. Six
weeks after sailing, finding constant head winds, and
in want of provisions, the water nearly consumed,
the crew asked the Captain what he intended to do—the
Captain told them, he had still some coffee which
he would give them for their support, and that he
would try to get to Bermuda; but after 24 hours,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>the winds against them, they tried for New-York, but
without success. On the morning of the 8th of January,
three of the crew went and seized the Captain,
as he was walking on the deck, and tied him.
They said that he and those that lived in the cabin,
must either jump overboard, or go into the jolly
boat along side. They then embarked the Captain,
who wished and asked to go into the cabin for his
cloak and boots, but he was not allowed. They
begged earnestly for a compass; his lady also went
on her knees and begged for a compass, but this
was refused also. His lady with their two children,
one a boy two years old, the other a girl four years
old, Mr. Robert Meredith, a passenger, and a mulatto
boy named William, steward in the cabin,
were then forced into the boat, with 20 lbs. of bread,
two trunks of the Captain’s and Mr. Meredith’s
trunks and two oars, were sent adrift. The crew
were ignorant of their then latitude. After ten
days sailing for the West-Indies, Deseada was the
first land he made. They had rigged the long-boat
as a sloop, put in their baggage and money, which
had been equally divided among them, excepting
the two lads, who had a share between them, when
two of the crew went below and scuttled the ship.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Afterwards the rest of the crew confessed their
crime. About 1400 dollars were found and lodged
at the Register’s office—Murdock said he buried in
the yard of the tavern at the Mole 450 dollars, but
the money could not be found. He had an American
protection, said he was born in New-Brunswick,
(N. J.) and had papers from the grand and
private lodges of New-York. The cook was a negro,
from Philadelphia, from whence he went in a
schooner to Halifax; his name was Philip Fisher;
he stuttered. One was a French lad; one a London
boy, one Welshman, an Irishman, and two
Scotchmen.</p>

<p class='c000'>The brig Cobbessecontee, Capt. Jackson, arrived
yesterday from the Havana, sailed thence on the
morning of the 8th ult. and on the evening of the
same day, about four miles from the Moro, was
brought to by a piratical sloop, containing about 30
men. A boat from her, with ten men, came along
side, and soon after they got on board commenced
plundering. They took nearly all the clothing from
the Captain and mate—all the cooking utensils and
spare rigging—unrove part of the running rigging—cut
the small cable—broke the compasses—cut the
mast’s coats to pieces—took from the Captain his
watch and four boxes cigars—and from the cargo
three bales cochineal and six boxes cigars. They
beat the mate unmercifully, and hung him up by the
neck under the main-top. They also beat the Captain
severely—broke a large broad sword across
his back, and ran a long knife through his thigh, so
that he almost bled to death. Capt. Jackson saw
the sloop at Regla the day before.</p>

<p class='c000'>Capt. Jackson informs us, and we have also been
informed by other persons from the Havana, that
this system of Piracy is openly countenanced by
some of the inhabitants of that place—who say that
it is a retaliation on the Americans for interfering
against the Slave Trade, and for allowing Patriot
privateers to refit in their ports. The pirates,
therefore, receiving such countenance, grow more
daring—and increase in number from the success
which has attended this new mode of filling their
pockets.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>Capt. Bugnon, who arrived yesterday from Charleston,
spoke on the 2d inst. off the S. Shoal of Nantucket,
the brig Three Partners, from Jamaica for
St. John—had been robbed, off Cape Antonio, by
a piratical vessel, of about 35 tons, and 17 men, of
clothing, watches, &amp;c. and the captain was hung up
by the neck to the fore-yard arm, till he was almost
dead.</p>

<p class='c000'>Capt. Bourn, who arrived yesterday, from Cape
Haytien, spoke on the 26th ult. lat. 33, lon. 78, brig
Sea Lion, 36 days from Cape Haytien for Belfast,
Ireland, which had been plundered by a pirate in
the Gulf.</p>

<p class='c000'>The brig Harriet, Capt. Dimond, from St. Jago de
Cuba for Baltimore, arrived at Havana on the 16th
ult. having been robbed of all her cargo of sugar,
and $4000 in specie, off Cape Antonio, by a boat with
15 men, having two schooners in co. Capt. D. was
hung up by the neck, and remained senseless for
some time after he was taken down.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dutch brig Mercury, 77 days from Marseilles,
arrived at Havana on the 16th ult. after having been
robbed of $10,000 worth of her cargo, by a piratical
schooner and boat, off Cape Antonio.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fortunately a U. S. vessel has arrived at the scene
of these daring robberies, and has already protected
two fleets. It is to be hoped some of the villains
who have so long preyed with impunity on mercantile
property, and been guilty of the most savage
acts, will speedily be caught and brought to justice.</p>

    <div><em>A letter from a gentleman belonging to this vessel, dated St. Barts, Nov. 3, 1821, says</em>—</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“We arrived here, after a rather rough passage,
in eighteen days from Boston, all well. We expect
to sail again in two or three days. We found here
the piratical ship which robbed the Orleans Packet.
She is now in possession of the Swedish government.
She came into their possession in the following
manner:—The crew landed her cargo on a
small island near this, from whence it was taken by
a schooner to St. Thomas;—they then run the ship
into Five Island Harbour, where all the crew, except
two men, deserted her.—The government
hearing of her being there, sent a guard and took
possession of her, brought her into this harbour, and
confined the two men found in her as pirates.—It is
said, Capt. Elton has requested the Governor to allow
him to take them to the United States for trial.
This piratical ship was originally the U. S. brig Prometheus,
which was condemned two years since,
and was then sold.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A letter from on board the Hornet, dated at Cape
Maise, 31st, October, says, “The pirate which we
took yesterday mounted two long four pounders,
and her crew consisted of twenty gallows-looking
scoundrels.”—After the capture of the Hornet, spoke

<h3 id='PIRACY' class='c007'>PIRACY.</h3>

<p class='c008'>In the early part of June I sailed from Philadelphia
in the schooner Mary, on a voyage to New-Orleans.
My principal object in going round by sea
was the restoration of my health, which had been
for many months declining. Having some friends
in New-Orleans whose commercial operations were
conducted on an extensive scale, I was charged
with the care of several sums of money in gold and
silver, amounting altogether to nearly eighteen
thousand dollars. This I communicated to the captain,
and we concluded to secure it in the best manner
our circumstances would admit. A plank was
accordingly taken off the ribs of the schooner in my
own cabin, and the money being deposited in the
vacancy, the plank was nailed down in its original
place, and the seams filled and tarred over. Being
thus relieved from any apprehension that the money
would be found upon us in case of an attack from
pirates, my mind was somewhat easier. What other
articles of value I could conveniently carry about
with me, I did so. I had also brought a quantity of
bank notes to the amount of fifteen thousand dollars.
Part of these I caused to be carefully sewed in the
left lapel of my coat, supposing that in case of my
being lost at sea, my coat, should my body be found,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>would still contain the most valuable of my effects.
The balance was carefully quilted into my black
silk cravat.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our crew consisted of the Captain and four men,
with a supply of live stock for the voyage, and a
Newfoundland dog, valuable for his fidelity and sagacity.
He had once saved his master from a
watery grave, when he had been stunned and
knocked overboard by the sudden shifting of the
boom. I was the only passenger on board. Our
voyage at first was prosperous, and time went on
rapidly. I felt my strength increase the longer I
was at sea, and when we arrived off the southern
coast of Florida, my feelings were like those of another
man.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was towards the evening of the fourteenth day,
two hours before sun-set, that we espied a sail astern
of us. As twilight came, it neared us with astonishing
rapidity. Night closed, and all around was impenetrable
darkness. Now and then a gentle wave
would break against our bow and sparkle for a moment,
and at a distance behind us, we could see the
uneven glow of light, occasioned by the foaming of
the strange vessel. The breeze that filled our canvass
was gentle, though it was fresh.</p>

<p class='c000'>We coursed our way steadily through the night;
though once or twice the roaring of the waves increased
so suddenly, as to make us believe we had
passed a breaker. At the time it was unaccountable
to me, but I now believe it to be occasioned
by the bark behind us, coming rather near in the
darkness of the night.—At midnight I went on deck.
Nothing but an occasional sparkle was to be seen,
and the ocean was undisturbed. Still it was a fearful
and appalling darkness, and in spite of my endeavours
I could not compose myself. At the windlass,
on the forecastle, three of the sailors, like myself,
unable to sleep had collected for conversation.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>On joining them, I found our fears were mutual.
They all kept their eyes steadily fixed upon the unknown
vessel, as if anticipating some dreadful event.
They informed me that they had put their arms in
order and were determined to stand or die.</p>

<p class='c000'>At this moment a flash of light, perhaps a musket
burning priming, proceeded from the vessel in pursuit,
and we saw distinctly that her deck was covered
with men. My heart almost failed me. I had
never been in battle, and I knew not what it was.
Day at length dawned, and setting all her canvass,
our pursuer gained alarmingly upon us. It was
evident that she had followed us the whole night,
being unwilling to attack us in the dark.—In a few
minutes, she fired a swivel and came along side. She
was a pirate. Her boat was lowered, and about a
dozed hideous looking objects jumped in, with a
commander at their head. The boat pushed off, and
was nearing us fast, as we arranged ourselves for
giving her a broadside. Our whole stock of arms
consisted of six muskets and an old swivel used as
a signal gun, belonging to the Mary, and a pair of
pistols of my own, which I carried in my belt. The
pirate boat’s crew were armed with muskets, pistols,
swords, cutlasses, and knives; and when she came
within her own length of us, we fired five of our
muskets and the swivel into her. Her fire was
scarcely half given, when she filled and went down
with all her crew. At this success we were inclined
to rejoice, but looking over the pirate schooner, we
observed her deck still swarming with the same
description of horrid looking wretches. A second
boat’s crew pushed off, with their muskets pointed
directly at us the whole time. When they came
within the same distance as the other, we fired, but
with little, if any effect. The pirate immediately returned
the fire, and with horrid cries jumped aboard
of us. Two of our brave crew were lying dead upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>the deck, and the rest of us expected nothing better.
French, Spanish, and English, were spoken
indiscriminately, and all at once. The most horrid
imprecations were uttered against us, and threats
that fancy cannot imagine.</p>

<p class='c000'>A wretch whose black, shaggy whiskers covered
nearly his whole face, whose eyes were only seen at
intervals from beneath his bushy eye-brows, and
whose whole appearance was more that of a hell-hound
than of a human being, approached me with
a drawn cutlass in his hand. I drew one of my pistols
and snapped it in his face; but it flashed in the
pan, and before I could draw the other, the pirate,
with a brutality that would have disgraced a cannibal,
struck me over the face with his cutlass, and
knocked me down. I was too much wounded by
the blow to resist, and the blood ran in torrents
from my forehead. In this situation the wretch
seized me by the scalp, and thrusting his cutlass in
my cravat, cut it through completely. I felt the cold
iron glide along my throat, and even now the very
thought makes me shudder. The worst idea I had
ever formed of human cruelty seemed now realized,
and I could see death stare me in the face. Without
stopping to examine the cravat, he put it in his
pocket, and in a voice of thunder exclaimed “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">levez
vous?</span></i>” I accordingly rose on my feet, and he pinioned
my hands behind my back, led me to the gunwale
of the vessel, and asked another of the gang,
in French, whether he should throw me overboard.
At the recollection of that scene I am still staggered.
I endeavoured to call the prospects of eternity before
me, but could think of nothing except the cold
and quiver-less apathy of the tomb. His infamous
companion replied, “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il est trop bonne heure l’envoyer
au diable</span></i>,” and led me to the foremast, where
he tied me with my face to the stern of the vessel.
The cords were drawn so tight around my arms
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>and legs, that my agony was excruciating. In this
situation he left me.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>On looking round, I found them all employed in
plundering and ransacking every thing we had.
Over my left shoulder one of our sailors was strung
up to the yard arm, and apparently in the last agonies
of death; while before me our gallant Captain
was on his knees and begging for his life. The
wretches were endeavouring to extort from him the
secret of our money; but for a while he was firm
and dauntless. Provoked at his obstinacy, they
extended his arms and cut them off at the elbows.
At this, human nature gave way, and the injured
man confessed the spot where we had concealed
our specie.—In a few moments it was aboard their
own vessel. To revenge themselves on our unhappy
captain, when they had satisfied themselves
that nothing else was hidden, they spread a bed of
oakum on the deck before, and after soaking it
through with turpentine, tied the captain on it, filled
his mouth with the same combustibles, and set the
whole on fire. The cries of the unfortunate man were
heart-rending, and his agonies must have been
unutterable; but they were soon over. All this I
was compelled to witness. Heart-sick with the
sight, I once shut my eyes, but a musket discharged
close to my ear, was a warning sufficient to keep
them open.</p>

<p class='c000'>On casting my eyes to the stern of the vessel, I
discovered that the boatswain had been nailed to
the deck through his feet, and the body spiked
through to the tiller. He was writhing in the last
agonies of crucifixion.—Our fifth comrade was out
of sight during all this tragedy; in a few minutes,
however, he was brought upon the deck blindfolded.
He was then conducted to the muzzle of the swivel,
and commanded to kneel. The swivel was then
fired off, and his head was dreadfully wounded by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>the discharge. In a moment after, it was agonizing
to behold his torments and convulsions—language
is too feeble to describe them. I have seen men
hung upon the gibbet, but their death is like sinking
in slumber when compared with his.</p>

<p class='c000'>Excited with the scene of human butchery, one
of those wretches fired his pistol to the captain’s
dog. The ball struck his shoulder and disabled
him; he finished him by shooting him again, and at
last by cutting out his tongue! At this last hell-engendered
act, my blood boiled with indignation
at such savage brutality on a helpless, inoffensive
dog! But I was unable to give utterance or action
to my feelings.</p>

<p class='c000'>Seeing that the crew had been every one despatched,
I began to think more of myself. My old
enemy, who seemed to forget me, once more approached
me; but shockingly besmeared with blood
and brains. He had stood by the side of the unfortunate
sailor who suffered before the swivel, and
supported him with the point of his bayonet. He
drew a stiletto from his side, placed its point upon
my heart and gave it a heavy thrust. I felt its
point touch my skin; but the quilting of my bank
bills prevented its further entrance. This savage
monster then ran it up my breast, as if intending
to divide my lungs, and in doing so, the bank bills
fell upon the deck. He snatched them up greedily,
and exclaimed, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ah! laissez mois voir ce que
reste.</span>” My dress in a few moments, was ripped to
pieces at the peril of my life. He frequently came
so near as to tear my skin and deluge me with
blood; but by the mercy of Providence, I escaped
from every danger.—At this moment a heavy flaw
struck the schooner, and I heard one of the pirates
say, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voila un vaisseau!</span>” They all retreated precipitately,
and gaining their own vessel, was soon
out of sight.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>Helpless as I now was, I had the satisfaction of
knowing that the pirates had been frightened by
the appearance of a sail, but it was impossible for
me to see it. Still tied to the foremast, I knew not
what was my prospect of release.—An hour or two
had elapsed after they left me; and it was now
noon. The sun played violently upon my head, and
I felt a languor and debility that indicated approaching
fever. My head gradually sunk upon my breast,
when I was shocked by hearing the water pouring
into the cabin windows. The wretches had scuttled
the vessel, and left me pinioned to go down with
her. I commended my Spirit to my Maker, and
gave myself up for lost. I felt myself gradually
dying away, and the last thing I remembered was
the foaming noise of the waves. This was occasioned
by a ship passing by me. I was taken in,
restored to health, and am now a poor, ruined, helpless
man.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c000'>The ship Liverpool Packet, Ricker, of Portsmouth,
N. H. was boarded on the 16th off Cape St. Antonio,
Cuba, by two piratical schooners; two barges containing
thirty or forty men, robbed the vessel of
every thing moveable, even to her <em>flags</em>, rigging,
one boat which happened to be afloat, and having a
boy in it which belonged to the ship. They held
a consultation whether they should murder the crew,
as they had done before, or not—in the mean time
taking the ship into anchoring ground. On bringing
her to anchor, the crew saw a brig close along
side, burnt to the water’s edge, and three dead bodies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>floating near her.—The pirates said they had
burnt the brig the day before, and <em>murdered all
the crew</em>!—and intended doing the same with them.
They said “look at the turtles, (meaning the dead
bodies) you will soon be the same.” They said
the vessel was a Baltimore brig, which they had
robbed and burnt, and murdered the crew as before
stated, of which they had little doubt.—Capt. Ricker
was most shockingly bruised by them. The mate
was hung till he was supposed to be dead, but came
to, and is now alive. They told the captain that
they belonged in Regla, and should kill them all to
prevent discovery.</p>

<p class='c000'>Jan. 16, 1822, sea account, at 1 P. M.—Pan of
Matanzas bearing S. saw a boat coming to us from
a small drogher, which came out of Matanzas the
night before us, with five Spaniards, armed with
long knives, pistols, cutlasses, &amp;c. When they got
within hail, they fired a musket at us, cheered, and
came on board. They were the most villanous
looking rascals that any one had probably ever beheld.
They immediately drew their weapons, and
after beating us severely with their cutlasses, drove
us below. They then robbed us of all our clothes
except what we had on, our watches, and every
thing of value. We were afterwards called up singly.
Four men with drawn knives stood over the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>captain, and threatened him if he did not give up
his money, they would kill all hands and burn the
vessel. After robbing the people they commenced
plundering the brig. They broke open the hatches,
made us get out our boat and carry their plunder
to their vessel. They took from us one compass,
five bags coffee, one barrel sugar, nearly all our provisions,
our colours, rigging, and cooking utensils.
They then ordered us to stand to the north, or they
would overhaul us, murder the crew and burn the
vessel. We made sail, and shortly after were brought
to by another boat of the same character, which fired
into us, but left us upon being informed that we had
been already robbed.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c010'>The Porpoise, Capt. Ramage, arrived at Charleston
from his successful cruise against the Pirates,
having recaptured a Baltimore schooner which had
been in their possession three days, destroyed three
of their establishments on shore, 12 of their vessels,
besides two on the stocks, and brought in four prisoners,
against whom it is supposed there is strong
evidence.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is stated, that a Pirate Captain and his mate
quarrelled on the question of putting to death all
captives,—they fought a duel with muskets, the
Captain was killed, and the Mate (who was the
advocate of mercy) succeeded to the command.</p>

<p class='c000'>The schooner Jane, of Boston, was taken the 24th
Jan. by a pirate schooner.—They were carried into
a place where were three more of the same trade.—The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>captain and crew were threatened, beat, and
the vessel plundered of much property; after which
they were released.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the Spanish Government is unable to drive the
Pirates from their strong holds in Cuba, the Baltimore
Chronicle suggests the necessity of occupying
the island with American forces for that purpose, as
robbers and pirates have a right to enjoy no protection
whatever; and in this case all civilized powers
are warranted in carrying the war into the enemy’s
territory.</p>

<h3 id='CAPTURED' class='c007'>PIRATES CAPTURED.</h3>

<p class='c008'><em>Charleston, Feb. 12.</em>—The four pirates brought
into this port by the United States Porpoise, were
landed yesterday from that vessel, and committed
to prison. Three of them are Spaniards, the other
a Portuguese; two of the former father and son,
the son being only about 18 years of age.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c000'><em>Charleston, Feb. 14, 1824.</em>—The United States
schooner Grampus, Lieut. Gregory, from a cruise
of 4 months in the West-Indies and along the Spanish
Main, arrived at our port yesterday morning,
last from Santa Martha. She has brought in three
Pirates, viz. James Maxfield, one of the crew that
robbed the Orleans, of Philadelphia, and Charles
Owens and James Ross, who robbed a Portsmouth
schooner of $2600 in the Bite of Leogane. One of
these daring free-booters was delivered up to Lieut.
G. by the Governor of St. Barts, and the other two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>by the President of Hayti, for trial by the United
States. The G. has boarded several privateers
during her cruise, and traversed a space of 9000
miles, spreading terror among those wretches
whose impotence is equal to their atrocity, and who
only require active pursuit to frighten them out of
visible existence.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c000'><em>Mobile, June 1, 1822.</em>—Capt. Carter of the schr.
Swan, arrived yesterday from Havana, reports that
on his outward passage from this port, on the 27th
ult. at 8 o’clock, A. M. being then within 30 miles
from Havana, he was boarded by an open boat from
the shore, manned with nine men, who all appeared
to be Spanish, armed with muskets, pistols, cutlasses,
and knives, who plundered the vessel of
every thing they could carry off. They also robbed
the captain and crew of their clothing, even stripping
the jackets from their backs, and the shoes
from their feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>The villains would not even spare the property of
a Spanish Priest, passenger on board, but they robbed
him also of his clothes, money, and plate, the
value of 800 dollars; they however afterwards, returned
his gown.</p>

<p class='c000'>A sail heaving in sight, they left the schooner
with orders to steer E. N. E. and not go over three
leagues from shore, under pain of death. From
their conversation while on board, it appeared that
they intended to board the schooner again in the
evening, run her ashore and burn her, but she escaped
by the darkness of the night.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The gallant ALLEN is no more!—You witnessed
the promptitude with which he hastened to relieve
the vessels which I informed him had been captured
off this port. He arrived just in time to save five
sail of vessels which he found in possession of a
gang of pirates, 300 strong, established in the Bay
of Lejuapo, about 15 leagues east of this. He fell,
pierced by two musket balls, in the van of a division
of boats, attacking their principal vessel, a fine
schooner of about eighty tons, with a long eighteen
pounder on a pivot, and four smaller guns, <em>with the
bloody flag nailed to the mast</em>. Himself, Capt.
Freeman of Marines, and twelve men, were in the
boat, much in advance of his other boats, and even
took possession of the schooner, after a desperate
resistance, which nothing but a bravery almost too
daring could have overcome. The pirates, all but
one, escaped by taking to their boats and jumping
overboard, before the Alligator’s boats reached them.
Two other schooners escaped by the use of their
oars, the wind being light.</p>

<p class='c000'>Capt. Allen survived about four hours, during
which his conversation evinced a composure and
firmness of mind, and correctness of feeling, as
honourable to his character, and more consoling to
his friends than even the dauntless bravery he
before exhibited.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Surgeon of the Alligator in a letter to a
friend, says, “He continued giving orders and conversing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>with Mr. Dale and the rest of us, until a
few minutes before his death, with a degree of
cheerfulness that was little to be expected from a
man in his condition. He said he wished his relatives
and his country to know that he had fought
well, and added that he died in peace and good will
towards all the world, and hoped for his reward in
the next.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Lieut. Allen had but few equals in the service.
He was ardently devoted to the interest of his
country, was brave, intelligent, and accomplished in
his profession. He displayed, living and dying, a
magnanimity that sheds lustre on his relatives, his
friends, and his country.</p>

<p class='c008'>The British schooner Speedwell arrived at Nassau
N. P. in November, bringing in 18 pirates, who
had been captured by the Speedwell and her consort.
The schooner had been disguised as a merchantman,
and the pirates, taking her to be an easy
prize, came carelessly along side of her, for the
purpose of boarding, when she gave them a hot fire,
and threw them into confusion. Many jumped overboard
and were drowned; and with these and the
killed, the loss of the pirates was about 15 or 16.
The remainder of them, 18 in number, were taken
prisoners and carried into Nassau.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yesterday Commodore PORTER left this port
in the steam galley Enterprize, to join the squadron
fitted out at Norfolk, for the purpose of suppressing
piracy on the coast of Cuba. Every friend of humanity
must wish that the efforts of the distinguished
officer who has been selected to this command
will be crowned with success. The means adopted
are certainly the best calculated to effect the object.
Frigates and sloops of war are totally inadequate,
by means of their great draft of water; but the vessels
which have been selected by Commodore <span class='sc'>Porter</span>,
are precisely calculated to ferret the banditti
from their lurking places. The aid of steam we
think a most valuable addition to the squadron, and
from the manner in which the Enterprize has been
fitted out, we have every reason to believe she
will completely answer the expectations formed.
Commodore <span class='sc'>Porter</span> has been indefatigable since
he came here, and several of our citizens conversant
in steam affairs, volunteered their services to
aid him in the necessary equipments for that department.
We learn that she is provided with duplicates
of every piece of machinery which might be
carried away in action, and that able and experienced
engineers were also procured for her.</p>

  <h3 id='EXECUTION' class='c007'>EXECUTION OF THE PIRATES.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Ten of the pirates captured by the British sloop
of War Tyne, were executed at Kingston, Jamaica,
on Friday, the 7th of February, 1823.</p>

<p class='c000'>About a quarter of an hour before day dawn, the
wretched culprits were taken from the jail, under a
guard of soldiers from the 50th regiment, and the
City Guard. On their arrival at the wherry wharf,
the military retired, and the prisoners, with the
Town Guard were put on board two wherries, in
which they proceeded to Port Royal Point, the usual
place of execution in similar cases. They were
there met by a strong party of military, consisting
of 50 men, under command of an officer. They
formed themselves into a square round the place of
execution, with the Sheriff and his officers with the
prisoners in the centre. The gallows was of considerable
length, and contrived with a drop so as to
prevent the unpleasant circumstances which frequently
occur.</p>

<p class='c000'>The unfortunate men had been in continual prayer
from the time they were awakened out of a deep
sleep till they arrived at that place, where they were
to close their existence.</p>

<p class='c000'>They all expressed their gratitude for the attention
they had met with from the Sheriff and the inferior
officers. Many pressed the hands of the turnkey to
their lips, others to their hearts, and, on their knees,
prayed that God, Jesus Christ, and the Virgin Mary,
would bless him and the other jailers for their goodness.
They all then fervently joined in prayer. To
the astonishment of all, no clerical character, of any
persuasion, was present. They repeatedly called
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>out, “<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Adonde esta el padre</span>,” (Where is the holy
father.)</p>

<p class='c000'>Juan Hernandez called on all persons present to
hear him—he was innocent; what they had said
about his confessing himself guilty was untrue. He
had admitted himself guilty, because he hoped for
pardon; but that now he was to die, he called God,
Jesus Christ, the Holy Ghost, the Virgin Mary, and
the Saints, to witness that he spoke truth—that he
was no pirate, no murderer—he had been forced.
The Lieutenant of the pirates was a wretch, who did
not fear God, and had compelled him to act.</p>

<p class='c000'>Juan Gutterez and Francisco de Sayas were loud
in their protestations of innocence.</p>

<p class='c000'>Manuel Lima said, for himself, he did not care;
he felt for the old man (Miguel Jose.) How could
he be a pirate who could not help himself? If it
were a Christian country, they would have pardoned
him for his gray hairs. He was innocent—they had
both been forced. Let none of his friends and relations
ever venture to sea—he hoped his death would
be a warning to them, that the innocent might suffer
for the guilty. The language of this young man
marked him a superior to the generality of his companions
in misfortune. The seamen of the Whim
stated that he was very kind to them when prisoners
on board the piratical vessel. Just before he was
turned off, he addressed the old man—“<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Adios viejo,
para siempre adios.</span>”—(Farewell, old man, for ever
farewell.)</p>

<p class='c000'>Several of the prisoners cried out for mercy, pardon,
pardon.</p>

<p class='c000'>Domingo Eucalla, the black man, then addressed
them. “Do not look for mercy here, but pray to
God; we are all brought here to die. This is not
built for nothing; here we must end our lives. You
know I am innocent, but I must die the same as
you all. There is not any-body here who can do us
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>any good, so let us think only of God Almighty. We
are not children but men, you know that all must
die; and in a few years those who kill us must die
too. When I was born, God set the way of my
death; I do not blame any body. I was taken by
the pirates, and they made me help them; they
would not let me be idle. I could not show that this
was the truth, and therefore they have judged me
by the people they have found me with. I am put
to death unjustly, but I blame nobody. It was my
misfortune. Come, let us pray. If we are innocent,
so much the less we have to repent. I do not come
here to accuse any one. Death must come one day
or other; better to the innocent than guilty.” He
then joined in prayer with the others. He seemed
to be much reverenced by his fellow prisoners. He
chose those prayers he thought most adapted to the
occasion. Hundreds were witnesses to the manly
firmness of this negro. Observing a bystander listening
attentively to the complaints of one of his fellow
wretches, he translated what had been said into
English. With a steady pace, and a resolute and
resigned countenance, he ascended the fatal scaffold.
Observing the executioner unable to untie a
knot on the collar of one of the prisoners, he with
his teeth undid it. He then prayed most fervently
till the drop fell.</p>

<p class='c000'>Miguel Jose protested his innocence.—“<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">No he
robado, no he matado ninguno, muero inocente.</span>”—(I
have robbed no one, I have killed no one, I die
innocent. I am an old man, but my family will feel
my disgraceful death.)</p>

<p class='c000'>Francisco Miguel prayed devoutly, but inaudibly.
His soul seemed to have quitted the body before he
was executed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Breti Gullimillit called on all to witness his innocence;
it was of no use for him to say an untruth
for he was going before the face of God.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>Augustus Hernandez repeatedly declared his innocence,
requested that no one would say he had
made a confession; he had none to make.</p>

<p class='c000'>Juan Hernandez was rather obstinate when the
executioner pulled the cap over his eyes. He said,
rather passionately—“<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Quita is de mis ojos.</span>”—(Remove
it from my eyes.) He then rubbed it up
against one of the posts of the gallows.</p>

<p class='c000'>Miguel Jose made the same complaint, and drew
the covering from his eyes by rubbing his head
against a fellow sufferer.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pedro Nondre was loud in his ejaculations for
mercy. He wept bitterly. He was covered with
the marks of deep wounds.</p>

<p class='c000'>The whole of the ten, included in the death warrant,
having been placed on the scaffold, and the
ropes suspended, the drop was let down. Nondre
being an immense heavy man, broke the rope, and
fell to the ground alive. Juan Hernandez struggled
long. Lima was much convulsed. The old man
Gullimillit, and Miguel, were apparently dead before
the drop fell. Eucalla (the black man) gave one
convulsion, and all was over.</p>

<p class='c000'>When Nondre recovered from the fall and saw
his nine lifeless companions stretched in death, he
gave an agonizing shriek; he wrung his hands,
screamed “<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Favor, favor, me matan sin causa. O!
buenos Christianos, me amparen, ampara me, ampara
me, no hay Christiano en asta, tiara?</span>” (Mercy,
mercy, they kill me without cause—Oh, good Christians,
protect me, protect me, oh, protect me. Is
there no Christian in this land.)</p>

<p class='c000'>He then lifted his eyes to Heaven, and prayed
long and loud. Upon being again suspended, he
was for a long period convulsed. He was an immense
powerful man, and died hard.</p>

  <h3 id='CAPTURED2' class='c007'>PIRATES CAPTURED.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The famous pirate, La Cata, was captured, off the
Isle of Pines, about the 1st of March, 1823, by the
British cutter Grecian, after a smart action. The
cutter had 50 men—the pirate 100, and 8 guns; it
was believed that about 30 of the crew of the latter
were killed, but only three prisoners were made,
the rest making their escape on shore. Considerable
quantities of goods were found on board the
prize.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Grecian conveyed the prisoners to Jamaica,
where, it seems, there is more law to reach cases
of piracy than in the United States.</p>

<h3 id='KILLED' class='c007'>LAFITTE, THE NOTED PIRATE, KILLED.</h3>

<p class='c008'>A British sloop of war fell in with and captured a
piratical vessel with a crew of sixty men, under command
of the famous <span class='sc'>Lafitte</span>. He hoisted the
bloody flag and refused quarter, and fought until
nearly every man was killed or wounded—<span class='sc'>Lafitte</span>
being among the former.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c000'>The schooner Pilot, of Norfolk, was captured
by the pirates off Matanzas, and her crew much
abused; but they were put ashore, and the wretches
went on a cruise in the prize, and captured and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>robbed two vessels, <em>within two miles of the Moro
castle</em>, Havana. A few days after, the U. S. schooner
Jackall fell in with her and made a re-capture,
securing, however, only one of the pirates; but
several of them were killed in the action, fighting
desperately. Several captures were made about
the same time by Com. Porter’s squadron, which
was actively employed.</p>

<h3 id='BATTLE' class='c007'>BATTLE WITH THE PIRATES.</h3>

<p class='c008'>Almost every day furnished accounts evincing the
activity of Commodore Porter, and the officers and
men under his command; but for a long time their
industry and zeal was rather shown in the <em>suppression</em>
of piracy than the <em>punishment</em> of it. At length,
however, an opportunity offered for inflicting the
latter, as detailed in the following letter, dated Matanzas,
July 10, 1823.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have the pleasure of informing you of a brilliant
achievement obtained against the pirates on
the 5th inst. by two barges attached to Commodore
<span class='sc'>Porter’s</span> squadron, the Gallinipper, Lieut. Watson,
18 men, and the Musquito, Lieut. Inman, 10 men.
The barges were returning from a cruise to windward;
when they were near Jiguapa Bay, 13 leagues
to windward of Matanzas, they entered it—it being
a rendezvous for pirates. They immediately discovered
a large schooner under way, which they
supposed to be a Patriot privateer; and as their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>stores were nearly exhausted, they hoped to obtain
some supplies from her. They therefore made sail
in pursuit. When they were within cannon shot
distance, she rounded to and fired her long gun, at
the same time run up the bloody flag, directing her
course towards the shore, continuing to fire without
effect. When she had got within a short distance
of the shore, she came to, with springs on her cable,
continuing to fire; and when the barges were within
30 yards, they fired their muskets without touching
boat or man; our men gave three cheers, and prepared
to board; the pirates, discovering their intention,
jumped into the water, when the bargemen,
calling on the name of “<span class='sc'>Allen</span>,” commenced a
destructive slaughter, killing them in the water and
as they landed. So exasperated were our men, that
it was impossible for their officers to restrain them,
and many were killed after orders were given to
grant quarter. Twenty-seven dead were counted,
some sunk, five taken prisoners by the bargemen,
and eight taken by a party of Spaniards on shore.
The officers calculated that from 30 to 35 were
killed. The schooner mounted a long nine pounder
on a pivot, and 4 four pounders, with every other
necessary armament, and a crew of 50 to 60 men,
and ought to have blown the barges to atoms. She
was commanded by the notorious Diableto or Little
Devil. This statement I have from Lieut. Watson
himself, and it is certainly the most decisive operation
that has been effected against those murderers,
either by the English or American force.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This affair occurred on the same spot where the
brave <span class='sc'>Allen</span> fell about one year since. The prize
was sent to Thompson’s Island.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A British sloop of war, about the same time, captured
a pirate schooner off St. Domingo, with a crew
of 60 men. She had 200,000 dollars in specie, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>other valuable articles on board. The brig Vestal
sent another pirate schooner to New-Providence.</p>

<h3 id='CUBA' class='c007'>CAPTURE OF A PIRATICAL STATION IN CUBA.</h3>

<p class='c008'>The U. S. schooners of war Greyhound and Beagle
left Thompson’s Island, June 7, 1823, under the
command of Lieuts. Kearney and Newton, and
cruised within the Keys, on the south side of Cuba,
as far as Cape Cruz, touching at all the intermediate
ports on the island, to intercept pirates. On the 21st
July, they came to anchor off Cape Cruz, and Lieut.
Kearney went in his boat to reconnoitre the shore,
when he was fired on by a party of pirates who
were concealed among the bushes. A fire was also
opened from several pieces of cannon erected on a
hill, a short distance off. The boat returned, and
five or six others were manned from the vessels, and
pushed off for the shore, but a very heavy cannonade
being kept up by the pirates on the heights, as
well as from the boats were compelled to retreat.
The two schooners were then warped in, when they
discharged several broadsides, and covered the landing
of the boats. After a short time the pirates retreated
to a hill that was well fortified. A small
hamlet, in which the pirates resided was set fire to
and destroyed. Three guns, one a four pounder,
and two large swivels, with several pistols, cutlasses,
and eight large boats, were captured. A cave,
about 150 feet deep, was discovered, near where
the houses were, and after considerable difficulty, a
party of seamen got to the bottom, where was found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>an immense quantity of plunder, consisting of broadcloths,
dry goods, female dresses, saddlery, &amp;c.
Many human bones were also in the cave, supposed
to have been unfortunate persons who were taken
and put to death. A great deal of the articles were
brought away, and the rest destroyed. About forty
pirates escaped to the heights, but many were supposed
to have been killed, from the fire of the
schooners, as well as from the men who landed.
The bushes were so thick that it was impossible to
go after them. Several other caves are in the neighbourhood,
in which it was conjectured they occasionally
take shelter.</p>

<h3 id='TAKEN' class='c007'>PIRATES TAKEN AND EXECUTED.</h3>

<p class='c008'>A piratical vessel, and her crew of thirty-eight
men were captured off Matanzas on the 16th May,
1825, by a British cutter and a steamboat fitted out
at that place. Several of the pirates were killed,
and the rest sent to Havana for trial. It was ascertained
that some of them had assisted in capturing
more than twenty American vessels, whose crews
were <span class='fss'>MURDERED</span>!!</p>

<p class='c000'>An additional gang of pirates was hung at the
same period, at Porto Rico.—Eleven at once.</p>

  <h3 id='GIBBS' class='c007'>CHARLES GIBBS, <em>otherwise</em> JAMES D. JEFFERS, AND THOMAS I. WANSLEY.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>This atrocious villain was a native of Providence in
Rhode-Island. His true name was James D. Jeffers,
but as he was more generally known as Charles Gibbs
we shall give him that appellation. His adventures,
excepting the crime for which he was finally hanged,
are only known from his own admissions while under
sentence of death, and our readers must judge for
themselves how far they are to be credited.</p>

<p class='c000'>It appears from evidence legally taken, that the brig
Vineyard sailed from New-Orleans about the first of
November, eighteen hundred and thirty, for Philadelphia.
William Thornby was the master of the vessel,
and William Roberts the mate. The crew consisted
of seven persons, viz. Charles Gibbs, John
Brownrigg, Robert Dawes, Henry Atwell, James
Talbot, A. Church, and Thomas I. Wansley, a young
negro native of Delaware, who acted as cook.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the Vineyard had been five days at sea, Wansley
made it known to the crew that there were fifty
thousand dollars in specie on board. This information
excited their cupidity, and induced them to consult on
the means of getting the money into their own hands.
Many conversations took place on the subject, and
while these were going on, Dawes, who was a mere
boy, was sent to converse with the officers, in order to
divert their attention from what was passing. Finally
it was <em>resolved</em>, that as the master and mate were old
men, it was time they should die and make room for the
rising generation. Moreover, they were of opinion that
as the mate was of a peevish disposition, he deserved
death. Yet, to do no man injustice, it does not appear
that Brownrigg or Talbot had any part in these
deliberations, or in the foul deed that resulted from
them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The conspirators agreed to commit the greatest
earthly crimes, murder and piracy, on the night of the
twenty-third. The murder of the master was assigned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>to Gibbs and Wansley; that of the mate to
Atwell and Church.</p>

<p class='c000'>The vessel was off Cape Hatteras, when the time
fixed for the murder arrived. The master was standing
on the quarter-deck, Dawes had the helm, and
Brownrigg was aloft. Dawes called Wansley aft to
trim the light in the binacle. The black moved as if
to obey, but coming behind Mr. Thornby, struck him
on the back of the neck with the pump brake, so that
he fell forward, crying “murder!” Wansley repeated
his blows till the master was dead, and then, with
the assistance of Gibbs, threw the body overboard.
While this deed of darkness was being done, the mate,
aroused by the noise, came up the companion ladder
from the cabin. Atwell and Church were waiting for
him at the top of the ladder, and one of them struck
him down with a club; but the blow did not kill him.
Gibbs followed to complete the work, but not being
able to find the mate in the dark, returned to the deck
for the binacle light. With this he descended and
laid hands on the victim, but was not able to overcome
him, even with the aid of Atwell; but finally,
with the assistance of Church, he was dragged on
deck, beaten and thrown overboard. He was not yet
dead, and swam after the vessel four or five minutes,
crying for help, before he sank. All these transactions
were witnessed by the boy Dawes, who had a
passive, if not an active part in them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The pirates then took possession of the vessel, and
Wansley busied himself in wiping up the blood that
had been spilled on deck, declaring, with an oath,
that though he had heard that the stains of the blood
of a murdered person could not be effaced, he would
wipe away these. Then, after drinking all round,
they got up the money. It was distributed in equal
portions to all on board; Brownrigg and Talbot being
assured that if they would keep the secret, and share
the plunder, they should receive no injury.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>They then steered a northeasterly course toward
Long-Island, till they came within fifteen or twenty
miles of South-Hampton Light, where they resolved
to leave the vessel, in the boats, though the wind was
blowing hard. Atwell scuttled the brig and got into
the jolly boat with Church and Talbot, while Gibbs,
Wansley, Dawes and Brownrigg, put off in the long
boat. The jolly boat swamped on a bar two miles
from the shore, and all on board were drowned. The
long-boat was in great danger also, and was only
saved from a like fate by throwing over several bags
of specie. Nevertheless, the crew at last got on shore
on Pelican Island, where they buried their money,
and found a sportsman who told them where they
were. They then crossed to Great Barn Island, and
went to the house of a Mr. Johnson, to whom Brownrigg
gave the proper information. Thence they went
to the house of a Mr. Leonard, where they procured a
wagon to carry them farther. As they were about to
get in, Brownrigg cried aloud that they might go
whither they pleased, but he would not accompany
them, for they were murderers. On hearing this Mr.
Leonard sent for a magistrate, and Gibbs and Dawes
were apprehended. Wansley escaped into the woods,
but was followed and soon taken.</p>

<p class='c000'>The evidence of the guilt of the prisoners was full and
conclusive. Their own confessions of the crime gratuitously
made to Messrs. Meritt and Stevenson, who
had the custody of them from Flatbush to New-York,
could have left not the shadow of a doubt on the mind
of any person who heard the testimony of those officers.
Wansley told the whole story, occasionally prompted
by Gibbs, and both admitted that Brownrigg was innocent
of any participation in their crimes. Their
confession was not, however, so favorable to Dawes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gibbs was arraigned for the murder of William
Roberts, and Wansley for that of William Thornby.
They were both found guilty, and the district attorney
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>moved for judgment on the verdict. There was nothing
peculiar in their deportment during the trial.
The iron visage of Gibbs was occasionally darkened
with a transient emotion, but he had evidently abandoned
all hope of escape, and sat the greater part of
the time with his hands between his knees, calmly
surveying the scene before him. Wansley was more
agitated, and trembled visibly when he rose to hear
the verdict of the jury.</p>

<p class='c000'>The judge proceeded to pass sentence on them severally,
that each should be taken from the place
where they then were, and thence to the place of confinement,
and should be hanged by the neck till dead;
and that the marshal of the Southern District of New-York
should see this sentence carried into execution
on the twenty-second day of April following, between
the hours of ten and four o’clock.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first account which Gibbs gave of himself is,
that his father obtained a situation for him in the
United States sloop of war Hornet, Captain Lawrence,
during the last war with England, in which vessel he
made two cruises; in the last of which she captured
and sunk the enemy’s sloop of war Peacock off the
coast of Pernambuco, after an engagement of twenty
minutes. On the arrival of the Hornet in the United
States, Captain Lawrence was assigned by the government
to the command of the frigate Chesapeake,
then lying in Boston harbor, and Gibbs accompanied
him to that ill-fated vessel in the month of April,
eighteen hundred and thirteen.</p>

<p class='c000'>This statement of his services was proved to be
false, and acknowledged as such by himself. His
motive for the falsehood was, to conceal his real adventures
about this time, that his proper name might
not be discovered. There is much to corroborate and
nothing to disprove what follows.</p>

<p class='c000'>After his exchange, he abandoned all idea of following
the sea for a subsistence, went home to Rhode
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>Island, and remained there a few months, but being
unable to conquer his propensity to roving, he entered
on board a ship bound to New-Orleans, and thence to
Stockholm. On the homeward passage they were
compelled to put into Bristol, England, in distress,
where the ship was condemned, and he proceeded to
Liverpool. He returned to the United States in the
ship Amity, Captain Maxwell.</p>

<p class='c000'>After its arrival, he left the ship, and entered on
board the Colombian privateer Maria, Captain Bell.
They cruised for about two months in the Gulf of
Mexico, around Cuba, but the crew becoming dissatisfied
in consequence of the non-payment of their prize-money,
a mutiny arose, the crew took possession of
the schooner, and landed the officers near Pensacola.
A number of days elapsed before it was finally decided
by them what course to pursue. Some advised that
they should cruise as before, under the Colombian
commission; others proposed to hoist the black flag.
They cruised for a short time without success, and it
was then unanimously determined to hoist the black
flag and declare war against all nations. At last one
of the crew, named Antonio, suggested that an arrangement
could be made with a man in Havana, that
would be mutually beneficial; that he would receive
all their goods, sell them, and divide the proceeds.
This suggestion being favorably received, they ran
up within two miles of Moro Castle, and sent Antonio
on shore to see the merchant and make a contract
with him, which was done.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Maria now put to sea, with a crew of about
fifty men. The first vessel she fell in with was the
Indispensable, an English ship, bound to Havana,
which was taken and carried to Cape Antonio. The
crew were immediately destroyed: those who resisted
were hewed to pieces: those who offered no resistance,
were reserved to be shot and thrown overboard. Such
was the manner in which they proceeded in all their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>subsequent captures. The unhappy being that cried
for mercy, in the hope that something like humanity
was to be found in the breasts even of the worst of
men, shared the same fate with him who resolved to
sell his life at the highest price. A French brig, with
a valuable cargo of wine and silk, was taken shortly
after: the vessel was burnt and the crew murdered.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sanguinary scenes through which Gibbs had
passed, now effectually wrought up his desperation to
the highest pitch, and being as remarkable for his
coolness and intrepidity as he was for his skill in navigation,
he was unanimously chosen to be their leader
in all future enterprises. To reap a golden harvest
without the hazard of encountering living witnesses
of their crimes, it was unanimously resolved to spare
no lives, and to burn and plunder without mercy.
They knew that the principle inculcated by the old
maxim that “dead men tell no tales,” was the safe
one for them, and they scrupulously followed it.
Gibbs states that he never had occasion to give orders
to begin the work of death.</p>

<p class='c000'>He now directed his course towards the Bahama
Banks, where they captured a brig, believed to be the
William of New-York, from some port in Mexico,
with a cargo of furniture, destroyed the crew, took
her to Cape Antonio, and sent the furniture and other
articles to their friend in Havana. Sometime during
this cruise, the pirate was chased for nearly a whole
day by a United States ship, supposed to be the John
Adams; he hoisted Patriot colors, and finally escaped.
In the early part of the summer of eighteen hundred
and seventeen, they took the Earl of Moira, an English
ship from London, with a cargo of dry goods.
The crew were destroyed, the vessel burnt, and the
goods carried to the Cape. There they had a settlement
with their Havana friend, and the proceeds were
divided according to agreement.</p>

<p class='c000'>During the cruise which was made in the latter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>part of eighteen hundred and seventeen, and the beginning
of eighteen hundred and eighteen, a Dutch
ship from Curacoa was captured, with a cargo of
West-India goods, and a quantity of silver plate. The
passengers and crew, to the number of thirty, were
all destroyed, with the exception of a young female
about seventeen, who fell upon her knees and implored
Gibbs to save her life. The appeal was successful,
and he promised to save her, though he knew it would
lead to dangerous consequences among his crew. She
was carried to Cape Antonio, and kept there about
two months; but the dissatisfaction increased until it
broke out at last into open mutiny, and one of the pirates
was shot by Gibbs for daring to lay hold of her
with a view of beating out her brains. Gibbs was
compelled in the end to submit her fate to a council
of war, at which it was decided that the preservation
of their own lives made her sacrifice indispensable.
He therefore acquiesced in the decision, and gave
orders to have her destroyed by poison, which was
immediately done.</p>

<p class='c000'>The piratical schooner was shortly after driven
ashore near the Cape, and so much damaged that it
was found necessary to destroy her. A new sharp-built
schooner was in consequence provided by their
faithful friend in Havana, called the Picciana, and
despatched to their rendezvous. In this vessel they
cruised successfully for more than four years. Among
the vessels taken and destroyed with their crews, were
the Belvidere, Dido, a Dutch brig, the British barque
Larch, the other vessels enumerated in the list furnished
to Justice Hopson, and many others whose
names are not recollected. They had a very narrow
escape, at one time, from the English man-of-war brig
Coronation. In the early part of October, eighteen
hundred and twenty one, they captured a ship from
Charleston, took her to Cape Antonio, and were busily
engaged in landing her cargo, when the United States
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>brig Enterprise, Captain Kearney, hove in sight, and
discovering their vessels at anchor, sent in her barges
to attack them. A serious engagement followed; they
defended themselves for some time behind a four gun
battery, but in the end were defeated with considerable
loss, and compelled to abandon their vessels and
booty, and fly to the mountains for safety.</p>

<p class='c000'>They left hot poisoned coffee on the cabin table, in
hopes that some of the American officers would drink
it. This statement is confirmed by Captain Kearney.</p>

<p class='c000'>On Friday, April twenty-second, 1831, Gibbs and
Wansley paid the penalty of their crimes. Both prisoners
arrived at the gallows about twelve o’clock, accompanied
by the marshal, his aids, and some twenty
or thirty United States marines. Two clergymen attended
them to the fatal spot, where every thing being
in readiness, and the ropes adjusted about their necks,
the throne of mercy was fervently addressed in their
behalf. Wansley then prayed earnestly himself, and
afterwards joined in singing a hymn.</p>

<p class='c000'>The boy Dawes was not prosecuted, having been received
as State’s evidence against Gibbs and Wansley.</p>

<h3 id='MEXICAN' class='c007'>PIRACIES ON THE BRIG MEXICAN.</h3>

<p class='c008'>On the 26th day of August, 1834, His Britannic
Majesty’s brig of war Savage, from Portsmouth, England,
arrived at Salem, Massachusetts, having on
board sixteen of the crew of the piratical schooner
Panda, which robbed the brig Mexican, of Salem, on
the high seas, nearly two years since.</p>

<p class='c000'>The robbery committed upon the Mexican was one
of the most audacious and cruel acts of piracy ever
recorded. She was bound to Rio Janeiro from Salem;
and was boarded by a piratical schooner under Brazilian
colors, on the 20th of September, 1832, lat. 33,
long. 34, 30, and robbed of twenty thousand dollars
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>in specie, the officers and crew stripped of every thing
valuable, and fastened below, and the vessel set on fire
with the horrid intention of destroying her with all on
board. Captain Butman and his men succeeded in
getting on deck through the scuttle which the pirates
had left unsecured, and extinguished the flames, and
returned home. Our government ordered a vessel to
cruise in pursuit, but she gave up the chase as hopeless.
The piratical vessel was afterwards taken on the coast
of Africa, by His Britannic Majesty’s brig Curlew,
and destroyed, under the following circumstances:</p>

<p class='c000'>The Curlew arrived at St. Thomas, west coast of
Africa, from India, with orders to cruise on that coast;
and her commander having obtained information that
a schooner, suspected to be a pirate, was lying in the
river Nazareth, on the southern extremity of the coast,
immediately sailed in pursuit, and found the schooner
as described. The boats of the Curlew were manned
to take possession of her, when the crew of the schooner
fled to the shore, with the exception of four who
were taken prisoners. They had kindled a fire to destroy
the schooner, and she had been stripped of every
thing valuable. The fire was extinguished without
damage. She had no cargo on board, but her water
casks were all filled, and she was apparently ready
for another cruise. In her cabin were found a compass,
marked Boston, the flags and ensigns of different
nations, and custom-house papers made out at Havana.
In taking her down the river, she accidentally
blew up, and the Curlew’s purser and one man were
killed. The four men taken were shipped at St. Thomas
after the robbery of the Mexican. The Curlew’s
crew pursued the fugitives in various directions, and
succeeded in capturing an additional number of the
pirates; and several natives’ towns were burned by
the Curlew’s men. The pirates had an examination
in England before the proper authorities, when five of
them offered to turn king’s evidence, two of whom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>were admitted to testify. They were fully committed,
and the British government ordered them to this
country for trial, and the affidavits and documents
relative to their capture and subsequent confinement
and examination were delivered to the authorities in
this country.</p>

<p class='c000'>The pirates were tried before the United States
court at Boston, November 11th, 1834, which continued
for fourteen days, and resulted in the conviction
of seven of their number, five of whom were executed
agreeably to their sentence, the other two received a
reprieve from the President of the United States.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Execution of the Spanish Pirates.</em>—[Thursday,
June 11, 1835.]—Pursuant to previous arrangement,
Captain Don Pedro Gibert, and Juan Montenegro,
Manuel Castillo, Angel Garcia, and Manuel Boyga,
were yesterday morning summoned to prepare for
their immediate execution, agreeably to their sentence,
for having, while belonging to the schooner
Panda, committed piracy, by robbing the brig Mexican,
of Salem, of twenty thousand dollars, and afterwards
attempting to destroy the crew and all evidence
of their crime, by setting fire to the vessel. It
is understood, that, when the prisoners became thoroughly
convinced that there was no longer any
grounds to hope for a further respite, they entered
into a mutual agreement to commit suicide on
Wednesday night. Angel Garcia made the first attempt,
in the evening, by trying to open the veins
in each arm, with a fragment of a bottle, but was discovered
before he could effect his purpose, and a
stricter guard was afterwards maintained upon all of
them during the remainder of the night, and every
thing removed with which they might be supposed to
renew any attempt upon their own lives. Yesterday
morning, however, about nine o’clock, while the avenues
of the jail resounded with the heavy steps of a
host of acting marshals, and the “busy note of preparation”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>struck solemnly upon the ears of the spectators
within reach of its echo, Boyga succeeded in inflicting
a deep gash on the left side of his neck with a piece
of tin. The officer’s eye had been withdrawn from
him scarcely a minute, before he was discovered lying
on his pallet, with a peculiar trembling of his knees,
which induced the officers to examine if any thing had
suddenly happened to him. They found him covered
with blood, and nearly insensible; medical aid was at
hand, and the wound was immediately sewed up, but
Boyga, who had fainted from loss of blood, never revived
again. Two Catholic clergymen, the Rev. Mr.
Varella, a Spanish gentleman, and pastor of the Spanish
congregation at New-York, and the Rev. Mr.
Curtin, of this city, were in close attendance upon the
prisoners during the whole morning; and at a quarter
past ten, under the escort of the Marshal and his deputies,
accompanied them to the gallows, erected on
an insulated angle of land in the rear of the jail.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the procession arrived at the foot of the ladder
leading up to the platform of the gallows, the Rev.
Mr. Varella, looking directly at Captain Gibert, said—“Spaniards,
ascend to heaven.” Gibert mounted with
a quick step, and was followed by his comrades at a
more moderate pace, but without the least perceptible
indication of hesitancy. Boyga, unconscious of his
situation and destiny, was carried up in a chair, and
seated beneath the rope prepared for him. Gibert,
Montenegro, Garcia, and Castillo all smiled subduedly
as they took their appointed stations on the platform.
Judging only from Gibert’s air, carriage, and unembarrassed
eye, as he glanced at the surrounding multitude,
and surveyed the mechanism of his shameful
death, he might have well been mistaken for an officer
in attendance, instead of one of the doomed. With the
exception of repeating his prayers, after the clergyman,
he spoke but little. Soon after he ascertained his position
on the stage, he left it, and passing over to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>spot where the apparently lifeless Boyga was seated
on the chair, he bent over his shoulder and kissed him
very affectionately. He then resumed his station, but
occasionally turned round to Mr. Peyton the interpreter,
and the clergymen. Addressing his followers, he
said—“Boys, we are going to die; but let us be firm,
for we are innocent.” To Mr. Peyton, removing his
linen collar, and handing it to him, he said—“This is
all I have to part with—take it as a keepsake. I die
innocent, but I’ll die like a noble Spaniard. Good
bye, brother, we die in the hope of meeting you in
heaven.” Montenegro and Garcia, though exhibiting
no terror, vociferated their innocence, exclaiming—“Americans,
we are not <em>culpable</em>—we are innocent;
but we forgive all who have injured us.” Castillo
addressed himself to an individual, whom he recognised
in the front rank of the officers below the stage,
and said—“Adieu, my friend—I shall see you in
heaven—I do not care so much about dying, as to
have the Americans think I am guilty,” [culpable.]
All of them expressed great satisfaction at the intelligence
of De Soto’s reprieve.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Marshal having read the warrant for their execution,
and stated that De Soto was respited for sixty
days, and Ruiz for thirty, the ropes were adjusted
round the necks of the prisoners, and a slight hectic
flush spread over the countenance of each; but not
an eye quailed, nor a limb trembled, nor a muscle
quivered. As the cap was about to be drawn over
Gibert’s face, the Spanish Priest fervently embraced
him, and during the operation of covering the faces of
the others, the Rev. Mr. Curtin advanced to the railing
of the stage, and read a brief declaration on behalf of
the prisoners, addressed to the citizens of America
assembled, setting forth, that as at the trial they had
declared their innocence, so did they now continue to
do so. Boyga’s cap and rope were adjusted, as he
sat, supported by an officer, in the chair, which was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>so placed as to fall with the drop. At a quarter before
11, after every preparation was completed, and
while they were repeating to themselves, in scarcely
audible tones, their prayers, Deputy Marshal Bass
suddenly cut the small cord which restrained the
spring, and the platform fell without even the creaking
of a hinge. In falling, Boyga’s chair struck against
the bodies of the Captain and Garcia. Boyga struggled
slightly once after his descent, and Montenegro
and Castillo but little; Capt. Gibert did not die quite so
easily, the rope being placed behind his neck. Garcia
struggled most and longest—about 3 minutes. After
being suspended 30 minutes, the physicians in attendance
pronounced them dead, and they were cut down,
and placed in black coffins, in readiness in the yard.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is stated in many of the papers, that Captain Gibert
attempted to cut his throat on Wednesday night,
but this is not the fact. It is true that he pursued a
line of conduct on that night which induced the officers
to suspect that he intended to commit suicide. Mr.
Tavers, one of the guards, who understands the Spanish
language, overheard the signal agreed upon, by
the whole party. The Captain proposed to write till
one o’clock, when he was to bid “Good bye” to the
rest, and they were then to despatch themselves with
pieces of glass. Accordingly, at the appointed hour,
the Captain, having terminated his writing, destroyed
a part of his papers, retired to a corner of his cell, and
appeared to be arranging his person to “die with dignity;”
but being closely watched at the window, the
officers, Messrs. Shute and Pierce, entered his cell before
he had completed his toilet. They asked him
what he intended to do; but he was irritated by their
undesired intrusion, and, showing temper, declined
answering. Upon searching, they found a piece of
glass in his pocket. They then ironed him, with his
hands behind his back. He remained dogged in his
disposition, and blew the light out four times, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>the officer as often re-lighted, and threatened to put
his legs in irons if he persisted in putting it out.</p>

<p class='c000'>Montenegro, it was discovered, <em>after</em> his execution,
had cut his throat in two places, and had bled very
profusely, but had washed his shirt out in the morning
to conceal the attempt. It was the irritation of
the wounds, probably, that made him hold his head
a little awry when the rope was first put round his
neck. He was one of the most piratical looking of
the crew, but one of the most innocent, and was always
in pleasant humor. Garcia inflicted wounds
upon his arms after he was ironed.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Dying Declaration of the Pirates.</span>—The Catholic
Sentinel of Saturday contains the following declaration
of innocence, written in Spanish by Capt. Gibert,
and signed by his companions. The substance of it
was delivered from the platform, a few minutes before
their execution, by the Rev. Mr. Curtin, one of the
Catholic clergymen in attendance:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“Americans! we, the undersigned, were reduced
to this sad and ignominious fate by misfortune, not
by guilt. In this world we have nothing to hope;
but in the next, we confidently expect salvation from
the benign mercy of our heavenly Redeemer. Then,
Americans, we declare to you with our dying breath,
that we are innocent; and we now aver so in the
hearing of that God before whom we must in a few
moments appear;—but our souls will not, at that sacred
tribunal, be charged with debasing the last act
of our lives by the utterance of falsehood. We speak
the solemn truth;—we are not culpable,—and we
reiterate here, under the gallows, what we declared on
our trial, ‘<em>that we die innocent men</em>.’ May God forgive
those who brought us to this fatal end, as we leave the
world in peace with all men. Farewell, Americans.</p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
